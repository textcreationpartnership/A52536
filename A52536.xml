            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Greatneſs of my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in making this Addreſs, would appear more legible from the Greatneſs of your Character, did not the Subject, here treated of, hold ſome Proportion with the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whoſe Patronage it implores: In prefixing therefore your
<pb facs="tcp:100787:3"/>
Lordſhips Name to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treatiſe, after the Example of moſt Writers, I do in the very Front ſhew the Sum and Abridgement of the whole Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, not of what I have writ, but of what really is poſsible to be written of the Worth and Excellence of Man's Nature. There are two Things which do more eminently denominate a Man; Capacity, and Courage; of which, one laies claim to the Head, the other to the Heart, but both to your Lordſhip. This thoſe can witneſs, who have had the honour to ſtand within the Circles of the Court, and to be privy to the Debates of the
<pb facs="tcp:100787:3"/>
Royal Council, over which you now preſide. Nay, the whole Nation can witneſs it, your great Vertues having ſo often ſhewn themſelves upon the greateſt Theatre, and to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Benefit of this Kingdom, ſo that there is no man can be ſo blind as not to ſee them, nor ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, if he hath any ſenſe of his own, or of his Country's Safety, as not to own an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them.</p>
            <p>The Quarrel which your Lordſhip did eſpouſe, as it was the juſteſt, ſo was it the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the Age, whether we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Quality, the Number, and above all the Exquiſite Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
<pb facs="tcp:100787:4"/>
of the adverſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, amongſt which the old Sham of pretending Religion ſeem'd to be moſt Popular, which was no other than the Policy of the <hi>Algerines,</hi> who moſt deſign the Slavery of Chriſtians when they hang out Chriſtian Colours.</p>
            <p>Inſolence flew high when Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was proſperous, which was at the Point of breaking forth into open Rebellion, ſo that a more Helliſh Combuſtion had like to have ſubverted the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Houſe, than that deſign'd by the Powder-plot, had not His Majeſty of Bleſſed Memory timely ſeparated the Fire-brands. Before which time, even then
<pb facs="tcp:100787:4"/>
when the Royal Cauſe lay moſt ableeding, 'twas a piece doubtleſs of great generoſity in one of ſuch a Patrimonial Fortune, as that to which your Birth-right did entitle you, to eſpouſe and defend it, for in caſe of Defeat your loſs had been moſt conſiderable, and in caſe of Succeſs, you could not expect an encreaſe of Fortune from any Office of the State; So that no conſideration of your own Intereſt, but that only of Loyalty and true Honour could invite to Action: And yet let the Fortunes of Subjects be as great as the Exigences of Princes, the latter cannot be out of a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
<pb facs="tcp:100787:5"/>
of giving, nor the former of receiving ſuitable Rewards, and Marks of Bounty; This your Lordſhip has in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure taſted of in the Hereditary Honours conferred upon your Blood, ſuch a Reward being juſtly due to one, who with ſuch Courage, Conſtancy, and Succeſs did vindicate the Hereditary Rights of the Blood Royal, and the juſt Deſcent and Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the Engliſh Crown. Your Counſels were Loyal, and (what is yet more rare) proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous not only in the effect they had, but alſo in the Benefit we all enjoy, ſince 'tis not to be doubted but that they ſmoothed
<pb facs="tcp:100787:5"/>
the way to the glorious and peaceable Succeſsion of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt and moſt juſt of Kings, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe Reign we cannot but expect Felicity.</p>
            <p>The Preſervation of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy amongſt ſo many Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as threatned it and the Kingdom, was as great and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous as its Reſtoration; the Memories of thoſe, who were eminent herein, will be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred to Posterity: You had both of you the ſame Name; a Name which may it ever be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious, as it has been ever tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telar to this Kingdom, being now famous without a Fiction for deſtroying the Monster,
<pb facs="tcp:100787:6"/>
which was to be fed with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than Royal Blood. The Monster of the Age, which had the Ravenous Wolf always gnawing in his Boſom, had fore-ſight good enough of what your Counſels would produce, when he prevailed with the worſt part (I had almoſt ſaid the Rump) of a Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, to liſt you among thoſe five ever Honourable and Noble Peers, whom they petitioned to be removed from attendance on His Majesty of Sacred Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for no other Reaſon, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe your great Abilities made you capable to diſcover, and your great Courage made you
<pb facs="tcp:100787:6"/>
reſolute to oppoſe the Pernicious Practices of that Deſperate Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal.</p>
            <p>But as your Lordſhip has given ample Proof of the greatneſs of your Mind to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the correcting of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Miſdemeanours, I ſhall now crave leave to make trial of the ſame Magnanimity in Pardoning private Faults; And for this your Lordſhip will find ſufficient matter, if you give your ſelf the trouble to read the following Diſcourſe, which how much ſoever it may be beneath your Acceptance, will not be found, I hope, beyond your Pardon, which if I can obtain,
<pb facs="tcp:100787:7"/>

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of the Generation of Man, as alſo of the Animal and Rational Faculties.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>MAN the Subject of this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſe, is the Subject alſo of our Wonder, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him either in his firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, or in the continuance and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of his Race: After that Almighty God had in a wiſe and wonderful manner fram'd the World, in the laſt place he cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates Man after his own Image, and gives him Power and Dominion over all living Creatures: By this ſignifying that the Heavens and Earth with all their glorious Bodies, then in their greateſt Luſtre and Perfection, were all made for the Sake and Service of this one noble Creature, with which he ſummed up the whole Creation. But waving theſe Conſiderations, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Conſequences of that happy State (of which our Nature was depriv'd)
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100787:10"/>
as things of which we are informed only by Divine Revelation, it will be more ſuitable to the ſcope of this Diſcourſe to conſider Man as he now ſtands in a ſtate of Nature, ſubject to Generation and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and obnoxious to all the Changes incident to a mortal Life; and under this Capacity we may conſider him, as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of two parts, of a Soul, and of a Body.</p>
               <p>Firſt for his Body, and the Generation of it. 'Tis certain that humane Race is propagated by the ſame way as that of bruit Animals. It would be a laborious, tho not a tedious Curioſity to trace Nature in its ſeveral advances from the imperfect ſtate of an Embryon, to that of a mature Of-ſpring, contained in a juſt and full for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all its Parts. But 'tis Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſufficient for our preſent Thoughts, if we conſider the great variety of Parts which ſerve for the Conſtitution of a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Body: Some are uſeful for Life, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for Nutrition, others again for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Let us but conſider a little the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles of Images, the Regions of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, the curious formation in all the Inſtruments of Senſe; to which we may add the activity and ſubtlety of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the delicate Contexture of the Nerves, the various Articulations of the Voice, the Harmony of Features, together with the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100787:10"/>
proportion of Members in a humane Body, any one of which Conſiderations is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to engroſs the Study of ones whole Life, and is many times the ſubject of a Volume.</p>
               <p>Many nice and ſubtle Queſtions are ſtarted by the Curious, concerning the Uſe and Frame of each particular Organ of the Body, as alſo how the Blood, Nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Senſation are made. No leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive have they been about the firſt Principle of Life, which ſets the Wheels of this curious Engine on Work; As firſt, Whether there be one or more Souls in Man conformable to the Animal and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Faculties: Alſo whether the Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Soul be propagated in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as that of other living Creatures: Or, whether it be immediately Created and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd by God? For the better Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which Queſtions, I ſhall firſt give my Senſe and Notion of that which we call a Senſitive or Animal Soul, which I conceive to be nothing but an Ethereal Maſs of Spirit, or Flame rarified, which the Almighty in the firſt Creation of Things, infus'd into every living Creature after its Kind, ordaining alſo a ſeminal Power in each of them, to propagate the ſame to new Ofsprings ſucceſſively. As ſoon as ever the Parts begin to be form'd
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100787:11"/>
by Nature, this Animal and active Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple begins to exert its Heat and Force, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lodged in the Heart as in the Centre of the Body, from whence, as the Veſſels begin alſo to be form'd, it diſtributes it ſelf towards the extreme Regions, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating its Vital Heat by the Miniſtry of the Spirits; which Spirits alſo are nothing but Particles of that Original and Ethereal Flame, which is contracted and united in this Centre: The boyling Heat which flows from the union of ſo many Spirits, begets a Motion in the Heart, to which the Arteries being faſtned, the ſame Pulſe or Motion is communicated to them alſo; and leaſt the Spirits ſhould be made too Volatile, the wiſe Framer of Nature hath ordered the Blood to be their Vehicle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a liquid and glutinous Subſtance, and ſo moſt fit both to retain and to diſtribute them together with its ſelf into the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter parts of the Body: all which is extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly facilitated by the continual Operation of the Lungs, whoſe Function 'tis by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting freſh Supplies of cool Air to refri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerate the Heart, and to communicate thin and ſubtle Matter to make the Blood more florid and fluid: Now becauſe the Blood by reaſon of the great Volatility of the Spirits which are mix'd with it, is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually waſting; this Loſs is repaired by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100787:11"/>
Nutrition, or a freſh ſupply of new Spirits from the Aliment we take in, which after ſeveral percolations becomes Blood alſo, and is then conveighed to the Heart, and ſo into the Arteries, where it becomes the Vehicle of Life, and carries along with it new Spirits, by undergoing the ſame Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations of Nature. Whoſoever therefore ſhall duly weigh this Order, and conſider the Fabrick of each Part, will eaſily be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to give a rational Account of Nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Reſpiration, Motion, Senſation, with all the other Faculties belonging to a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive or Animal Body.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe we obſerve in Man ſome Operations more refin'd, and ſuch as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deriv'd from a meer Senſitive Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we are taught to conclude that there is another Principle into which ſuch Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations are reſolv'd, which we call a Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Soul. Indeed, whoſoever conſiders the curious Inventions of Wit, the vaſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion and ſubtile Inferences of the Underſtanding, the wonderful Sagacity and Proſpect of Prudence, the noble En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments and Speculations of the Mind, the quick Tranſitions and Succeſſions of Thoughts, together with the Bent and Subſerviency of the Paſſions, in relation to the Circumſtances of humane Life: I ſay, whoſoever thinks on theſe, muſt readily
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100787:12"/>
conclude that the Spring from whence ſuch Motions are deriv'd, muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more Celeſtial than that Etherial Spirit which gives Vigor to the Animal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</p>
               <p>True it is, the Rational Soul, if I may ſpeak it without a Soleciſme, is ſo incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated into the Animal, that it ſeems to have its Birth and Growth with it. How doth Reaſon exert it ſelf by little and little, what Helps and Arts are there us'd to make the Flower open and ſhew it ſelf to the World? What Struglings and Conflicts are there betwixt the Animal Inclinations, and the more maſculine Dictates of Reaſon? A ſure Demonſtration that they cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from one and the ſame immediate Impulſe of Nature. The Senſe and Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we have of Reputation, of Juſtice, of Commerce, of Patience, and Moderation, with infinite other things relating to the moral Capacity, have no analogy with the Actions and Sentiments of Beaſts, tho ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſagacious and well inſtructed; what then ſhall we ſay of the Intellectual Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and of the immenſe Capacity of the Mind?</p>
               <p>But do we not ſee that ſome Men who have rational Souls, and ſuch as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted of as good Education as the beſt, how they act upon the ſame Principles of Senſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100787:12"/>
and Beſtiality with other Creatures. 'Tis not therefore from Nature, but from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and adventitious Helps, that others make a different and more refin'd diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of themſelves. 'Tis true, we find ſome Men acting at a very extravagant rate, not only by following the Propenſities of Senſe, but by tranſgreſſing even the Dictates of Nature in Beaſts, by their Ingratitude and Infidelity towards thoſe they are obliged to; nay, ſometimes in killing themſelves, either Gradually by Intemperance, or more compendiouſly by the help of a Sword, or of a never-failing Halter. So far therefore is this Conſideration from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying my Aſſertion, that it doth exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly confirm it, ſince it eſtabliſheth that Liberty and Arbitrary Power of the Will, which is incommunicable with Beaſts, and is one of the chiefeſt Prerogatives of a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Soul. The grand Inſtruments by which the Underſtanding works, are Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and Invention: Now, ſince theſe Faculties have their foundation in the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Capacity, as this Prop is withdrawn, the Underſtanding muſt of Conſequence be more clouded and obſcure. Nay, tho the rational Faculties in, or a little before the moment of Death ſeem totally extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, (becauſe we are not ſenſible of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny effects they make) neither yet is this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100787:13"/>
any Argument of the Souls mortality: For when a man is profoundly aſleep, or (what is almoſt as natural to ſome) profoundly drunk, their is a ſeeming extinction of all the rational Powers; and yet for all this we find that where Nature is once deliver'd from ſuch oppreſſions, the Soul is the ſame in being as it was before.</p>
               <p>As therefore the Reaſonable Soul is in Nature and Operation diſtinguiſh'd from, and tranſcendently ſuperiour to the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, ſo in the next place 'tis very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that it has not its Original from the courſe of Nature, but from the immediate hand of God. This was a great queſtion heretofore betwixt St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome;</hi> and was proſecuted by the later with ſo much heat, as made him ſeem to tranſgreſs the bounds of Chriſtian Charity: But 'tis not my buſineſs in this Diſcourſe to make uſe of Theological Arguments, or to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe betwixt the Fathers in their Diſputes; they are at reſt, and let their works follow them: Thus much is obvious to our Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; That in the Generation of Bruits, we find every Animal does beget its like, not only in <hi>ſpecie</hi> or kind, but in diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and inclination of Nature. Fighting <hi>Cocks</hi> will beget a race like themſelves, ſo will <hi>Dogs, Horſes, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo conſtant and regular is Nature in thoſe productions,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100787:13"/>
that it ſeldom or never varies; but in the Generation of Man we oft-times experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the contrary: ſimple men are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puently the Fathers of great Hero's, and wiſe men may leave their Goods and Lands to their Sons without being able to Entail them upon the better part of their Poſſeſſions. <hi>Solomon</hi> had a <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and an <hi>Achitophel</hi> may have an Ideot for his Son: From whence it follows that ſuch different diſpoſitions muſt proceed from ſome Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, which lies not within the compaſs of Generation, and the ordinary courſe of Nature. 'Tis true; Education does many times change the courſe and ſtream of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Nevertheleſs we obſerve, how vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inclinations are ſo predominant in ſome, that no Example nor Precepts of Virtue, no hopes of Honour, no Culture of Art can ever reclaim them: But let the force of Education be what it will, in drawing men from their Natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions towards Vice or Virtue, 'tis certain that men vary extreamly from other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals in the Propagation of their Race. It has been reported of a great Family in this Kingdom, that Father and Son have alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately been wiſe and weak, and this for ſeveral Generations; and which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more remarkable alſo, thoſe who paſs'd under the character of being men of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100787:14"/>
parts, had all of them one and the ſame Chriſtian Name, as thoſe of the contrary denomination hapned all of them to have another. Now in this and many ſuch like caſes 'tis evident, that this difference of Nature could not proceed from Education, ſince all had the ſame means of Inſtruction and Breeding; nor yet from Generation, ſince all Animals produce others of the ſame Natural propenſities with themſelves: It remains therefore that it was deriv'd from ſome other Principle, from whence all Moral and Intellectual acts proceed, and ſuch as was ſuperiour to the Agents of Nature, which could be no other then the Rational Soul, form'd by the hands of God, and infus'd into the living creature. Now theſe Imperfections are not intrinſick, but accidental to the Soul, nor do they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue its corruptibility or mortality, any more than the ſpots and clouds we ſee in ſome <hi>Diamonds,</hi> do prove them to be leſs durable then others which are more limpid and tranſparent.</p>
               <p>From theſe two Propoſitions, that there is a difference betwixt the Senſitive and Rational Soul, and that the latter is infus'd immediately by God, may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd a third, <hi>viz.</hi> that this Soul is immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. The Immortality of the Soul cannot be inferred ſo fully from immediate To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100787:14"/>
of Reaſon, as from divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and from the conſent and practice of civiliz'd Nations. All people who were ever poliſh'd either by Literature or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, as they ever believ'd the Exiſtence of the Soul after death, ſo was their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice conformable to this Belief. Thoſe whom they lookt upon as Hero's in their life, they invokt as Deities after death, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotting alſo Torments to the Wicked, as well as Joy and Reſt to the Good. What therefore is thus built upon the Univerſal conſent of Ages, and was confirm'd by the Suffrages of all Mankind, I mean of all who had their Reaſon illuminated, muſt be lookt upon to be founded in the Law of Nature, which being ordain'd by God, carries on it the ſtamp and characters of Eternal Truth.</p>

as an Infant brought into the World, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to dangers, and ſtanding in need of others help and aſſiſtance.

They who are pent up among high Hills where the <hi>Sun</hi> can hardly reach them, are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſimple, as in <hi>Savoy:</hi> So likewiſe are the <hi>Switzers</hi> of groſs Intellectuals, but withall they are very faithful and valiant. The <hi>Florentines</hi> live in a Barren Country lying open to the Hills round about them, and are expos'd to a ſharp Air, for which reaſon they are reported to be more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and cunning than the reſt of the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians.</hi> The <hi>Scotch</hi> likewiſe, from the cold and barren Countries they inhabit, are more cunning far than the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and upon even ground will over-reach them.</p>
               <p>Whether Nurſes may be us'd for the nouriſhing of Infants has been a great que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; 'tis certain that the Milk which the Child draws from the Mothers Breaſt, and the blood with which it was nouriſh'd in the Womb differ only in colour, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be much more natural, and may be more eaſily converted into the ſubſtance of the Infant, than any foreign nouriſhment whatſoever, but becauſe we have greater
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100787:16"/>
choice of Nurſes then we have of Mothers; ſome Women, thoſe eſpecially who are more delicate and tender of their eaſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend this important duty of Nature to ſome mean ordinary perſon, which certainly can never be approv'd of but in caſe of infirmity, <hi>Melancholy,</hi> or of ſome natural defect. we may obſerve of Beaſts which are guided by the inſtinct of Nature, how ſolicitous they are to feed their Off-ſpring, till ſuch time as they can ſhift for themſelves; And even Birds which are the moſt timid of all Creatures, will lament bitterly, and expoſe themſelves to danger for the Preſervation of their Young, which at other times will take wing upon the ſight of a man; nay ſome will make reſiſtance and aſſault any thing which comes near them, as <hi>Geeſe, Hens,</hi> and the like, which when they have nothing to care for but themſelves, will upon any approach fly away. This ſhews what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion Nature has left upon the weakeſt Creatures to exert their utmoſt force for the Preſervation of their young ones, which Nature has taught them to prefer before their own; but amongſt Women this gentle and eaſy way of ſetting out their Children to Nurſe as it is more unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, ſo is it a means of diminiſhing the Mothers love and affection for them, as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100787:16"/>
experience tells us, and as manifeſt reaſon does evince; for why do Mothers love their Children more, tenderly and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately than the Fathers, but becauſe they endure greater pangs in their Birth, and greater troubles in the Education of them, which affection towards them is half de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd by ſuffering ſtrange Nurſes to ſhare with them in their Office. No woman knows the ſtate and circumſtances of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers body ſo well as of her own, nor can be aſſur'd of her being ſo careful as herſelf: ſome great Perſons have direly ſuffered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account, as King <hi>Philip</hi> the Third of <hi>Spain,</hi> who was all his life-time of a very languiſhing and ſickly temper, which he ſuckt from his Nurſe who was too much <hi>French.</hi> 'Tis true <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Romulus</hi> the Founders of two great Monarchies, were both expos'd in their Infancy, the one being ſaid to be nouriſh'd by a <hi>Bitch,</hi> the other by a <hi>Woolf,</hi> that is, as I ſuppoſe, amongſt Shepherds and Savage people, whom their natures and diſpoſitions little differed from the wild Beaſts amongſt which they liv'd: or perhaps ſuch Fables were invented only to make their Actions to ſeem more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and prodigious. Whatſoever there were in ſuch reports, certain 'tis; that great regard is to be had both to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Mind, as well as to the ſtate
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100787:17"/>
and condition of the body of her who gives the Breaſt; let her be of a cheerful humour and temperate as well as health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and abounding in Milk; but this more properly concerns the Mother, let us look a little to that which concerns the Father, and that is, the Breeding and Education of his Children, which is a great and weighty duty.</p>
               <p>Parents for the future good of their Children, would do well to place them forth as early as may be in a wholſom piercing Air, and by this means inure them to hardſhip by times. The old <hi>Germans</hi> were wont to plunge their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren into the <hi>Rhyne</hi> as ſoon as they were born, to bring their bodies to a ſtronger temper. Ladies we ſee of the moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Conſtitutions, by uſing to have their Breaſts and Arms naked from their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, receive no injury by the weather be it never ſo cold, whereas the ſtrongeſt man ſhould he attempt to do the like, might be in danger of his life. Let a Child therefore be accuſtom'd to courſe Dyet, to thin Cloathing, hard Lodging, and to much Toyl; and when he arrives to Manhood, his Conſtitution will be much more vigorous; he will be more hardy to undertake, and more ſtrong to conquer any difficulty. He will enjoy a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100787:17"/>
health of body, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence will be able to purſue any work, wherein the Brains and Thoughts are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd with great Alacrity, Conſtancy, and Courage: and indeed ſince the Occurran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of life do ſtill caſt a man upon the more painful ſide, 'tis beſt to make hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to grow up with our Natures, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtoming our ſelves to it when our blood is Youthful, when we are free from diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and at ſuch a ſeaſon alſo when the leaſt impreſſions grow into a habit, and many times become indeleble.</p>
               <p>There is one great fault which Parents generally commit in the Education of their Children, <hi>viz.</hi> in labouring to bring them to habits of good Husbandry and Frugality, by cutting them ſhort in their allowance: By this means many a young Gentleman is taught to keep mean Company; and gets ſuch habits of ſhifting and ſhirking, as ſhall for ever render him contemptible: others there are of this Tribe who ſpend without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, upon the proſpect of their Fathers death, ſo that when they come to their Eſtates, all they have will be too little to ſatisfie their Creditors; for ſuch are ever ſure to lend the young Squire freely, and make him indebted to them for twice as much as he borrow'd, upon pretence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100787:18"/>
that the old Gentleman may out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live the Son, and then all is deſperate. 'Tis generally ſeen that none are ſo extravagant and profuſe when they come to their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, as thoſe who in their Fathers life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time were kept ſhorteſt of Money. The more the Fire is pent in, the more violent will be the Eruption; but in all caſes 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that too great a reſtraint on Youth does make them wiſh their Parents death, and does engender thoſe ill humours in a Son as end commonly in Defiance and Rebellion.</p>
               <p>Upon the walls in the Court of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits Colledge at <hi>Lyons,</hi> where they have a great School, there are many ingenious Emblems painted in Freſco, of which this I remember to be one, an <hi>Eagle</hi> flying to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Sun</hi> with her Young ones in her Talons, caſting thoſe away as ſpurious which would not endure the Light, with this Motto, <hi>à teneris luce imbuit.</hi> 'Tis ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy to obſerve, but ſad to conſider what little care many Parents take in this particular; ſo they can but beget and keep their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren 'tis ſufficient. They are many times very induſtrious in improving their Eſtates, and in cultivating their Lands; but for their Children they let them converſe with the Poor ones of the Village, or with Plow-men or Servants of their own Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by this means they get many times
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100787:18"/>
ſuch habits, both of clowniſh ſpeech and carriage; as alſo of rudeneſs and of an abject Mind, as no future Education though it were beſtow'd upon them, will ever be able to wear away. We ſee a ſtraight Tree when it is young and tender, will eaſily be bow'd aſide, and grow ſo too beyond recovery if it be let alone a little; as alſo another which is young and crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may by little and little be in a great meaſure rectified, and by cutting away the ſuperfluities may become fruitful. As for thoſe who are to follow the Plow, or any Mechanick and Laborious courſe of life, (and ſuch there muſt be) as their Means and Opportunities are ſmall, ſo neither do their Circumſtances require any thing more then to be inſtructed in the Principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and of Morality, and in the Duties of Obedience, and to be able to Write and Read: for there is nothing more ridiculous, then to have a Bumkin or Shopkeeper, pretend to State-matters or Divinity: Nor indeed is there any thing ſo dangerous to Church or State, as theſe half headed and conceited Fellows, who are generally moſt Impudent, Ignorant and Factious. The Education therefore which I here diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of, is ſuch as I would have in thoſe who would be accounted Gentlemen, as having ſome Priviledges both of Birth and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100787:19"/>
Fortune, above the Common ſort of Men, which Education of theirs may be reduc'd to theſe three general heads, <hi>viz.</hi> Erudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Exerciſe, and Travel.</p>

               <p>ERudition extends it ſelf not only to Literature, but to Precepts of Life, the former ſerves for the information of the Underſtanding, the later for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Will, and for regulating the Paſſions, to both which things all civiliz'd Nations have ever had a ſpecial regard. The <hi>Chineſes</hi> boaſt themſelves to be the only civiliz'd People upon the Earth, looking upon all other Nations as <hi>Barbarians,</hi> which conſidering the little or no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage they have had by Commerce with other parts of the World may be in a great meaſure admitted. In this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar they are a reproach to the <hi>Europeans:</hi> for there is no Art nor Induſtry omitted by them, which may ſerve for the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and Education of Youth<hi>:</hi> All Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

places whether Civil or Military, are beſtow'd on ſuch Perſons only, as have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone the Teſt and Appprobation of their Doctors, in which charge they are not perfunctory and ſuperficial but ſevere. They have no Offices or Titles of Honour, but what Learning does procure them, and ſuch Reverence and Veneration have they for their Preceptors, that in caſe a Schollar be advanc'd to a higher place of Truſt and Dignity then his Maſter, yet he never ſits with him cheek by jole, but at a little diſtance behind, and on a lower ſeat, giving him the Stile and Compella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Maſter all his life after.</p>
               <p>'Tis far otherwiſe in this our Native Country, ſo much civiliz'd and poliſh'd as we pretend to be. There is nothing ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable as the Name of a <hi>Pedant,</hi> a Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low who can Teach a young Gentleman to ſcrape a Leg, or perhaps a Fiddle, for generally they go together, ſuch a one I ſay ſhall have a better Reception and Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry then he who has the Inſtitution of the Young Squire in the Methods of Learning, and in the Precepts of Life. Whether it be that we have really a leſs value for breeding then other Nations I know not, more probable 'tis that the meer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100787:20"/>
which afterwards ſeldom fails to be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd upon the Office. However 'tis ſtill our own faults, for were there ſufficient Encouragement, and ſuch Honour had for this grand Employment as really it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves; Men of Birth, Learning and Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and enobled with the beſt Qualities, would eaſily be invited to undertake this duty, but 'tis far otherwiſe: Our School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters generally are deſcended of the Dregs of the People; they are ſuch who being of wretched Education, do by a Collection among Friends, or by the Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty perhaps of ſome young Gentleman, make a ſhift to creep to the Univerſity, where after four years Drudgery for Meat and Drink, and living generally a ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and idle Life, they become <hi>Domini's,</hi> and muſt then ſhift anew for themſelves. Some there are of this Poorer ſort, who being men of Parts find means to make their Fortunes, and become afterwards brave Men; but generally they are ſuch as I here deſcribe: for being forc'd for want of Maintenance to run like Vagabonds ſeeking where to live, at length they Farm ſome Parſonage to halves, and patch up the reſt by keeping of a School. Now becauſe the meaner ſort of People by whom they live, are commonly Fanatic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 chunk">

                  </gap> and Factious, theſe Teachers alſo being
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100787:20"/>
for the moſt part of the ſame Race, and that they may the better inſinuate into the favours of thoſe by whom they are maintain'd, do imbue their Children with the ſame Principles. Moreover being Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who have no ſence of Breeding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor of the temper and ſprings of Youth, they commit infinite abſurdities, either by dampning the Spirits of the more remiſs by indiſcreet Corrections, or at other times by their own licentious Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples procuring Contempt on themſelves; by which means their Schollars as they grow in years and Underſtanding, begin to loath Reproof, which in a little progreſs of time renders Youth rude, obſtinate and incorrigible: 'tis true, ſome few publick Schools there are which being well endow'd are honour'd with Learned men, and ſend forth as hopeful Wits into the World, as are anywhere to be found: But this alas is but a very ſmall Proportion to the whole Body of the Kingdom: ſo that I take the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned defects to be the cauſe why ſo many miſcarry, and to be of great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to Church and State.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> certainly are well worthy our imitation in this particular: Nor is there any Art by which they create them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a greater intereſt in the Countries where the live, than that by which they
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100787:21"/>
undertake the Education of Youth. They who are deputed for this Employment, are not of the meaneſt quality; they are uſually Gentlemen, Men of mature years, and ſuch who have been well vers'd, not only in Ancient Authors, but in the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and Converſation of men, and in the methods of buſineſs: Their way is, by familiarity and ſoftneſs to inſinuate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Affections of the Scholar, and to draw him on to diligence rather by hopes, then to whip him forwards by Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Fear: And yet where Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence makes Correction a duty, they do it rather by inflicting ſome light diſgrace, than by Corporal chaſtiſement, a thing opprobrious to Nature, and which rather dulls than quickens the capacities of Youth. One thing they practice frequently which is really of wonderful uſe, and that is, their accuſtoming their Schollars to Act their Parts in Plays. This inures them to a Manlike ſpeech, and to a ſteedy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Addreſs. I like Tragedy better than Comedy, where the Argument common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is light, and is ſuch as requires much of the Buffoon, whereas the former being great and Maſculine, will be ſure to leave a Tincture of ſomething Noble upon the Mind of him who perſonates the Hero. Learning ought to be infus'd into the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100787:21"/>
Scholar like ſpirits into a Bottle, by little and little, for whoſoever attempts to pour in all at once, may in all likelihood ſpill a great part, and in a great meaſure fill the Veſſel with Wind and Air. The Veſſels 'tis true which have the ſtreighteſt Necks will not ſo readily receive the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quour, but then they will preſerve what they once receive with much more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and laſtingneſs of ſpirit. 'Tis ſo many times in the capacities of Youth: they who can receive any impreſſion like the Virgin-wax, will as eaſily ſuffer a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facement unleſs it be hardned and matur'd by Time: whereas others who are hard to be wrought upon like Steel, retain the Images which are Engraven on them with much more beauty and perpetuity.</p>
               <p>As for the Method of Erudition in Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature, that ſeems to me to be moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, which begins with thoſe Sciences which are founded in Memory and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, ſuch as learning of Tongues, Grammar, and Poetry: For certain 'tis that Memory in Youth is infinitely more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy than in men of riper years, as appears from their different capacitys in learning of a Language; and then for Invention which always builds out of the Store-houſe of Memory, 'tis then moſt perfect and various when the Spirits are moſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100787:22"/>
airy, and in their greateſt Circulation. Some are for Teaching young Scholars the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> upon pretence of fixing their Thoughts, and of keeping them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to one Subject, for upon the leaſt ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving they looſe ſight preſently of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, and muſt begin anew. But I like not this Method; for 'tis too tedious, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and puzling for young Capacities to ſtrugle with: for tho the progreſs be moſt natural and convincing, and the deductions of Theorems from one another, though they may raviſh the Contemplative, yet it requires a man to have a complex Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of many Propoſitions at once, ſo that the leaſt ſtartings and wandrings of the Mind, diſorder the whole clue and ſeries of thoughts. As for <hi>Oratory,</hi> I think it not ſo proper for Youth, unleſs it be ſo far only as the Exerciſe thereof comprehends Repetition or Rehearſal: For by this we endeavour to perſwade men, which we cannot do but by Topicks ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the conſideration of humane Affairs, from the Examples of paſt Ages, and of Foreign Countrys, to which muſt be added knowledge both of the Times and Perſons we Converſe with, and of the temper and inclination of their Paſſions, as alſo of the Nature of the Paſſions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, all which require much Reading,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100787:22"/>
Judgment and Experience, and do ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a man to be in ſome ſtate of Maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty far above the Stations of Youth; Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs the uſe of Declamations and Panegyricks, with ſuch leſſer Exerciſes as conſiſt in Ornaments of Wit and Fancy, are not improper for them, as the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance and rehearſal of them begets bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and a good addreſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>History</hi> as it is pleaſing and requires a good Memory, ſo it requires a mature Capacity to underſtand the ſcope and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of the Writer, to judge of all the the Circumſtances of Things, Perſons and Times, as alſo to fathom the depths of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and to diſcern the ſecret Reſorts which ſet the Wheels on work. <hi>Logick</hi> ſerves for little but to aſſiſt men to reduce Reaſoning into forms of Argument, and is therefore more proper for men fraught with Reaſon and of riper years. <hi>Natural Philoſophy</hi> is eaſie, copious and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. <hi>Metaphyſicks</hi> ſerve only to ſubtilize the Wit and to fill the Brain with abſtract No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and thus far alſo it may be uſeful too, for he who is able to raiſe mighty Speculations, and to diſtinguiſh of Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalities, Quiddities, Perſeities, Entities of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, non-Entities, that is to ſay, non-Senſities, and to talk profoundly of nothings, will be acute and quick ſighted enough when
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100787:23"/>
ſomething real ſhall occur: For which reaſon 'twas that the Lord <hi>Strafford,</hi> as I have heard, was wont always to read <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi>'s Metaphyſicks, even then when he ſate at the Helm of publick Affairs; which he did for this end, as I ſuppoſe, that he might be furniſh'd with diſtinctions, and that he might have his Reaſon always ſharpned with Subtleties. But I omit the Proſecution of theſe, and ſuch like Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Univerſal Learning, as falling under the Methods of our publick Univerſities, where they flouriſh in Perfection.</p>
               <p>I come now to conſider the other great Branch of Erudition, as it extends to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Life and of Morality. This, tho it be not ſo Ornamental, is much more uſeful than the former, by how much the Faculty of doing well, exceeds that of knowing well: The Devils are capable of the latter, but to underſtand all things, and to purſue the beſt, is proper only to Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical and Divine Natures. The Turks make little account of Learning, but as to their Morals, 'tis a Reproach to us, that they far exceed Chriſtians in the Virtues of Temperance, Obedience to Superiors, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Paſſions, and fidelity to their Words. How rigorous and ſevere is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and by what Induſtry and Methods are the Youths of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100787:23"/>
the Seraglio (thoſe eſpecially of a more noble Genius) wrought upon and improv'd, till at length being advanc'd to Office, they find an open Field for Merit to raiſe it ſelf, and by degrees arrive to places of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Truſt and Honour. In this particular they much reſemble the brave and ancient <hi>Spartans,</hi> who tho they did not forbid the knowledg of Letters, yet they little eſteem'd them, in reſpect of thoſe Duties and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts by which Life was to be govern'd, which were generally theſe: Firſt, To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence Old-Age. Secondly, Obedience to the Commands of their Superiors, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in time of War. For endurance of Pain and Hardſhip, none were ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to the <hi>Spartans,</hi> for their Youth would emulate one another in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and he only was accounted Heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal who could ſuffer the ſharpeſt Torments without change of Countenance. Their Dyet and Apparel was courſe, and in their Behaviour they were moſt modeſt and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive, inſomuch that they would never look up in publick, nor role their Eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, nor ſhew the leaſt ſign of being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, looking only upon what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Feet, and drawing up their Hands within the Pligs and Foldings of their Garments; and yet theſe were the braveſt Souldiers the World ever had, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100787:24"/>
this to be the grand and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable Duty, to which they were all obliged, <hi>viz,</hi> in fighting either to Conquer or to dye. Virtue and Civility are the ſureſt Badges of Valor. Ruffians and Bravo's may kill, but the moſt Victorious Nations, and the braveſt Generalls, were ever thoſe whoſe Minds were poliſh'd, whoſe Arms receiv'd a Luſtre from Virtue, and who could command their own Paſſions.</p>
               <p>Virtue has this Excellency, that it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to gain the Commendation of its Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: They who condemn it in their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, are forc'd to applaud it in their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In matters of Morality the Will is eaſily cotrupted, but 'tis not ſo with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Some perhaps out of a wantonneſs of Wit, or to excuſe their Extravagance, may ſhew themſelves good at the Burleſque; but we ſhall never meet with any ſo impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as ſeriouſly to attaque Virtue. Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Juſtice, Temperance, and Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are four Fortreſſes in Morality, which no Obloquy can blow down, nor Subtlety undermine. Vice therefore can never make a Conqueſt of Virtue, tho it may of Virtuous Perſons, by tempting them from their Duty, under the falſe colours of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: But the Victory which Virtue gains is entire: It not only ſubdues the vicious Perſon, but the Vice too, by begetting an
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100787:24"/>
utter Horror and Deteſtation of it. A grave and ſeaſonable Reproof doth many times proſtrate the moſt profligated Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>Beſides the Precepts of Philoſophers, we have the Practiſe even of Brutes to inſtruct us in the Duties of Morality: For if we attentively conſider it, there is ſcarce any Creature of this Denomination but is able to reprove and to direct us. And firſt for Temperance, We ſee how the Horſe, the Ox, with all the reſt of the Animal Tribe, are moſt regular in all the Functions of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor will any one of them be forc'd to drink more than what is ſufficient to extinguiſh their Thirſt, ſo that whilſt they live by Senſe, they act by Reaſon which ſays, that whatſoever exceeds the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and Neceſſities of the Body, is but a Surcharge to Nature, and will turn to Surfeit and Diſorder in the end. Nay that Creature which is look'd upon generally as the vileſt of all, as being the moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious Name we can give to any Man, I mean a Dog, will upon a juſt Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be found to be the greateſt Emblem of Heroick Virtue, being eminent for theſe three noble Qualities, Fidelity, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and Courage. There is no Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Blandiſhment, or Sufferance what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, which can make him deſert his

Maſter, no not Hunger it ſelf, which is the greateſt Pain this Creature can ſuffer, as being by Nature of an Appetite moſt craving and inſatiable. He fawns and expreſſes all Joy upon the approach of his Maſter, he takes all Correction at his Hands with Patience and Submiſſion, he will accompany him whereſoever he goes, he will defend him with the peril of his own Life, and will venture upon anything, tho never ſo difficult and dangerous, when he is encouraged by one who can protect and reward him. Such then is the force and power of Nature, and ſuch too as is ſufficient to inſtruct thoſe who are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Cuſtoms of a vicious Education.</p>
               <p>But for our better improvement in this moſt neceſſary and important Duty of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, I ſhall conſider this part of Eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which concerns Life and Practiſe, as reducible to theſe two general Heads. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Things Moral. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Things Civil; and this according to the two Notions we have of the double Capacity of Man: For every Man may be conſidered either abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, and in himſelf, and ſo he is a thing of an entire Nature and Perfection, and in this Capacity, he is the Subject of Moral Actions: Or <hi>Secondly,</hi> He may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Relatively, and as he ſtands in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with others, where he is conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100787:25"/>
only as a part, and in this Capacity he is the Subject of civil Actions. Now both theſe Capacities, as they have their ſeveral Virtues, ſo are there ſeveral Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods by which the Mind of Man may be made perfect in them.</p>
               <p>I begin firſt with Moral Actions: And here it is no way to be doubted, but that he who would work an Alteration on the Mind of Man, ought well to be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Bent and Genius of that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he intends to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>l with, as alſo of the Force and Nature of the Paſſions, together with the proper Motives to excite them; and this not only with relation to Men of riper Years, but of ſuch more eſpecially who are under the Methods of Inſtruction: Now the common Motives to Virtue, are ſuch as theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Reputation, Honour, Preferment, and conſequently Riches, with ſuch things as have an Influence upon Man, under the Notion of Reward: As on the contrary, Shame, Diſgrace, loſs of Intereſt or Office, danger of Eſtate or Life, all which being in the nature of Puniſhments, are of great force to diſſwade us from Vice; to which alſo I may add Company, Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, Examples, and Studies, all which things alſo are of great Force to incline Mens Minds to Good or Evil.</p>
               <p>But waving theſe and ſuch like Topicks
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100787:26"/>
as fitter for Rhetorick, and ſuch as would Swell this Chap. into a Volume, I ſhall only propoſe three practical Rules to ſuch as have the Care and Inſtitution of Youth; of which the firſt is this. Look what Vice a Man is naturally inclin'd to, endeavor to make him love the Vice which lies in the other Extreme: for there is no danger of his falling into it; but by drawing him to the contrary ſide, 'tis probable he may ſtay at the Golden Mean, like a crooked Stick which is made much more eaſy to ſtand ſtreight, by being bent as much the other way. We may apply this Rule alſo to the amendment of many Defects of the Body; for I account a Perſon who is ill-Shap'd, Splay-footed, and of an untowardly Gate, to be the fitteſt Perſon living to learn to Dance; not becauſe he is moſt apt for ſuch an Exerciſe, for Nature intends nothing leſs, but becauſe by putting a force upon Nature he will acquire ſome Habit of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and Preſence, which will make his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity appear leſs viſible.</p>
               <p>Another Rule is this: If Cuſtom and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has got ſuch an Aſcendent over the Mind, that it cannot be remov'd, the beſt Expedient is to joyn Iſſue with Nature, by puſhing it forwards. Thus we ſee that Fevers are beſt Cur'd by raiſing the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, and the moſt rational way to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100787:26"/>
the purulent Humors of the Body, is to drain them forwards into one great Iſſue of corrupt and putrid Matter. We find that many intemperate Perſons have been reform'd into Sobriety, by the effects of one ſubſtantial and round Debauch: And if one who is of a Cholerick Diſpoſition, will not be perſwaded by Reaſon to contain, it will not be the worſt Method to help him forwards in his Extravagance, which in all likelyhood may purchaſe him a good Beating, and this in all probability will make a greater Impreſſion on him, than all the Reproofs of moral Philoſophy, tho never ſo forcibly inculcated; but if this Method prove unſuccesful, the laſt Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to which Prudence can have Recourſe, is to make Vice ſhift it ſelf a little into the Quarters of the next neighbouring Virtue; for ſo it is, that many Vices have ſome Virtues or Courſes of Life, which are of the ſame Complexion under which they lurk and diſguiſe themſelves. Thus, if a Man be inclin'd to Cruelty, let him follow the Chaſe, if he be Cholerick and Revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, let him follow the War: for tho ſuch Perſons will never make Commanders, yet they are uſeful Tools enough in ſome Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, where Men of richer Mettle are not to be thrown away. Thus alſo, if a Man be Talkative and Litigious, let him
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100787:27"/>
follow the Practiſe of the Law, for ſuch a one will ſtill find quarrelſome matter of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Folks, ready cut to his Hands, on which he may diſcharge his Heat, without being the Author of any new Combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons himſelf, beſides that, his Eagerneſs and Heat will carry ſome ſhew of Zeal for the Cauſe, and Intereſt of his Client. In like manner Prodigality, by having ſome Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities lopt off, may paſs for Hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; ſo Ignorance and Cowardiſe will with little Alteration paſs for Gravity and Sage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>I come now to ſpeak of Man in his Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Capacity, or as he ſtands in Relation to others; and here the Duties are many, ſuch as thoſe betwixt Parent and Children, Husband and Wife, Maſter and Servants, to which I may add Traffick, Negotiation, and the Obligations every Man hath in his particular Calling, with many other Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which accompany an active Life. I ſhall only make a Curſory Remark upon one grand Duty, being that which every Man is obliged to, I mean the Love and Service which he owes to his Country, not as ſome factious Men pretend, who would appear its Patriots, on purpoſe to draw on the Ignorant Multitude to herd with them, under the Banner of Liberty, when in reality they deſign nothing but
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100787:27"/>
their own private and ambitious Ends, the Subverſion of the Government, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to reduce their Countrey to Confuſion and Slavery. By the Duties therefore, which we owe to our Country, I underſtand the Obligations we have upon us to live in Obedience to its Laws and Government, and to Sacrifice all our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Fortunes for the Preſervation of the ſame; for ſince the common Good is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Union or Combination of ſo many particular Mens Concerns, the Univerſal cannot be deſtroy'd, but the Parts of which it is Compounded, muſt ſhare alſo in the Ruine. The Hand and the Foot may think the Stomach to be an Idle and Unprofitable Portion of the Body, and yet if they refuſe to feed it, the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage will fall upon themſelves: For this Stomach which ſeems to devour all, and to do nothing it ſelf, if it be depriv'd of Nouriſhment, all the reſt of the Members will ſoon languiſh with it and dye: For let Men look upon Princes, as Perſons li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in Idleneſs and Luxury, yet in the Body Politick, they are the Stomach which doth Digeſt all, and diſtribute that Chyle of which the pureſt Blood is made, and by which all the Members are kept alive. There is alſo a Love and Duty which a Man owes to his Country in general, in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100787:28"/>
reſpect whereof every Man's private Life is no way to be reguarded; we have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this amongſt the Worthies of old, ſuch as <hi>Curtius</hi> and the <hi>Decii:</hi> But more remarkable was that known Example of <hi>Themistocles,</hi> who being baniſhed by the <hi>Athenians,</hi> fled to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Court for Relief and Shelter. The King rayſing an Army againſt the <hi>Grecians,</hi> appoints <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistocles</hi> to be General, which he knowing not well how to Avoid, or how to Accept of, he deſir'd Leave to Conſult upon it by a Sacrifice: A Bull was Slain, of whoſe Blood <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> drinking a hearty Draught, died himſelf a Victim at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and by this means ended the Conflict betwixt the Duties which he owed to his Ungrateful Country, and to his Merciful Protector. The Importance of that Duty which every individual Perſon owes to his Prince and Country, ought well to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by thoſe who have the Inſtitution of Youth, for as much as that is the Age of Ductility, and that the Impreſſions are then eaſily made, and will be laſting too, as growing dayly up with Nature.</p>

               <p>HAving ſpoken in the foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Improvements of the Mind by Erudition, it follows of Courſe that we ſpeak of the Improvement of the Body by Exerciſe. Indeed a Vigorous and Athletick Habit of Body, doth extreamly advance the like Diſpoſition and Ability in the Mind; Since all Intellectual Exerciſe and Travel of Brain depend much upon the Activity of the Spirits, and theſe upon the good Temper and Strength of the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. Upon this account it was, that <hi>Solon</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> Law-giver, and the wiſeſt Man in his Age, ordain'd that the <hi>Grecian</hi> Youth ſhould be train'd up to Wreſtling and Muſick, the one for the ſtrengthning of their Bodies, the other for the Poliſhing of their Minds. Strength, if it be not ſoftned, is Savage and Brutal, but where 'tis joyn'd with Courteſie 'tis Raviſhing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:100787:29"/>
Sports and Exerciſes ſerve not only to Recreate thoſe who are the Actors, but thoſe alſo who are the Spectators of them. The <hi>Greeks</hi> had ſolemn Times ſet apart for thoſe more Man-like Exerciſes repreſented in the <hi>Olympick Games,</hi> beſides their dayly Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements of the Theatre. The like alſo had the <hi>Romans;</hi> that of the <hi>Gladiators</hi> was ſomething too Inhumane, the other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of the <hi>Circus</hi> were much more Innocent, Diverting and Healthful, and even the more Indigent Sort were ſo wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to theſe Shews, that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented only to live upon Bread and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo they might but be admitted ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be Spectators at them, <hi>duas tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum res anxius optat, Panem &amp; Circenſes.</hi> But above all, their Triumphs were ſtately Things, and were deſign'd not only to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, but to encourage Men to brave At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chivements of Honour. In the beſt conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Governments it has been always look'd upon as a piece of Policy, to indulge the People in ſuch Recreations, as well becauſe they render Men quick in their Motions and Bold to Attempt, as alſo becauſe they extreamly conduce to alleviate the Cares and Burthens of the Mind, and to divert the Thoughts from ſeriouſly Reflecting upon the heavy Weight which is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times caſt upon them by the Exigences of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100787:29"/>
the State. For which Reaſon we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that where the People are moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd with Gabells and Impoſitions as in <hi>Italy,</hi> there they enjoy the greateſt Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in their Recreations, which are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Races, Plays, Opera's, Feats of Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the Fooleries of Ciarlatans, Sports of the Carneval, Cavalcades, Academies of Muſick, to which I may alſo add Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick Ceremonies and Divertiſements, ſuch as Proceſſions, the Feaſts of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Saints, as alſo the Canonization of Saints and Martyrs, with many other Shews both of Pomp and Activity, by all which they endeavour as much as poſſible, to ſweeten the ſourneſs and tediouſneſs of Life.</p>
               <p>As to the Exerciſes of the Bodies, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to particular Men, ſome are of great Uſe for Mans Preſervation, as Running, Vaulting, Fencing and Wraſtling<hi>:</hi> But withal they are ſometimes Incommodious to Health, becauſe they call upon a Man to exert his utmoſt Strength, which weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens Nature, inſomuch that thoſe who were beſt at the Performance in their youthful Days, feel the Smart in their declining Years, and are much weaker than other Men of the ſame Age: Beſides, ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes are many times dangerous to Life, eſpecially when Man and Man cope toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100787:30"/>
There are other Exerciſes which are leſs uſeful for a mans preſervation, but withal they contribute to health, by exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Spirits to a quick Circulation, and are lookt upon alſo as parts of Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuch as <hi>Dancing, Tennis,</hi> and <hi>Riding</hi> the great Horſe; <hi>Juſts</hi> and <hi>Turnaments</hi> were things of great Bravery; but they are now antiquated, and <hi>Maſques</hi> are for the Entertainments only of Ladies. <hi>Bowling</hi> end Shooting in the Long-Bow are leſs vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and more ſafe, becauſe they excite a moderate warmth, and are not apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray men to the dangers which follow ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive heats. But above all the <hi>Chaſe</hi> has been ever lookt upon as a Noble and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Divertiſement, it recreates and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Fancy whilſt the Body is in Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe: 'tis laſting and ſociable, and withal it inures the Body to hardſhip without too much fatigue or hazard, and never fails to procure a good Appetite which is the beſt friend to life. Theſe are the chiefeſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of the Body by which mans Nature may be rendred more perfect.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Muſick</hi> it may more properly be reckoned amongſt the Recreations of the Mind, if it be not the ſole Recreation of that moſt Excellent and Noble faculty, when the Paſſions are languiſhing and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſpent, this is able to animate and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100787:30"/>
Exalt them, and at other times when they are too exorbitant and impetuous, it is able to create a Calm, and to reduce the Soul to its due Temper and Serenity. 'Tis ſtrange what is reported amongſt the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients of its wonderful power and force. 'Tis well known they had their ſeveral Moods and Meaſures, which were able to produce very different and ſtrange effects in men. When the Trumpet ſounds we ſee not only Men but even Beaſts are anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a generous and Martial fire, and upon this Conſideration doubtleſs 'twas that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> (who were the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt men of <hi>Greece)</hi> tho they were moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere &amp; rigi'd in their Manners of Life, took ſpecial care to have their Children Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Muſick,</hi> not that ſoft and puling <hi>Muſick</hi> which conſiſts in Paſſionate and Effeminate expreſſions, in Affected ſighs and melting Notes, and in a languiſhing and dying poſture of body, but their <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick</hi> was Manlike and ſpritely, and ſuch as ſerv'd to excite the Mind to generous and brave Attempts. The Compoſition for the Matter conſiſted generally of two Parts: The firſt was <hi>Panegyrick,</hi> being a Commemoration of thoſe who dyed for their Country; the other was Invective, being in Diſpraiſe of thoſe who were Cowards and degenerate, all which they
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100787:31"/>
did expreſs plainly without any invention or ornament of Wit. Now as <hi>Muſick</hi> ſerv'd to raiſe their thoughts to noble Actions, ſo they lookt upon it alſo as very uſeful to ſweeten the Toyls and Labours of Life<hi>:</hi> upon which account the <hi>Arcadians</hi> who were Shepherds and inhabited a barren Country, being by their courſe of life, obliged to expoſe themſelves to all the hardſhips and inconſtancy of Weather, had recourſe to their Pipes, as the only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt the inconveniences to which Nature had laid them open; taking care that not only their Children, but their Young men alſo ſhould be Exercis'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in even to the Thirtieth Year of their Age. Nor were the <hi>Poets</hi> ignorant of the force of <hi>Muſick,</hi> when they feigned <hi>Orphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> drawing Trees and Beaſts after him, and <hi>Amphion</hi> Stones to build the Wall of <hi>Thebes:</hi> thereby ſignifying that it was capable to civilize the moſt Savage Natures, and to Eſtabliſh Cities and Governments. Then for the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> let <hi>Socrates</hi> ſerve as an inſtance, who when he was well advanc'd in years, thought it no diminution to his Gravity, to ſpend an hour or two every day with <hi>Conus</hi> the Muſitian in Learning to Sing to an Inſtrument, though 'tis not improbable that he did it alſo, to ſoften the noiſe of a louder Inſtrument, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100787:31"/>
which was far more difficult to be tun'd, his Wife. This is certain, that when a man is oppreſs'd with care and anxiety, and is under any diſturbance of Spirit, there is nothing in the World does ſo much revive him as <hi>Muſick,</hi> witneſs <hi>Saul,</hi> who is ſaid in Scripture to have been haunted by an Evil Spirit, which was no more but this; <hi>Saul</hi> finding his Government unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, and that things did not ſucceed and proſper according to his wiſhes, fell into <hi>Melancholly</hi> which (as 'tis obvious to all the World) does often times betray men to very extravagant fits of Jealouſie and Fury, which Evil Spirit of <hi>Saul</hi>'s could not be conjur'd by any other Art but of <hi>Davids</hi> Harp. Some have endeavour'd to repreſent <hi>Muſick</hi> more powerful and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive than <hi>Rhetorick</hi> it ſelf, from the Fiction of vigilant <hi>Argus,</hi> who could not otherways be overcome but by the charms of a Pipe.</p>
               <p>There are ſome things notwithſtanding in the Practiſe of <hi>Muſick,</hi> which ſeem much to derogate from its Worth and Vertue: As firſt, that it is Mercenary, and that it is uſually proſtituted in Taverns and Baw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-houſes, and ſerves frequently to uſher in the meaneſt Shows. It is frequently pretended to by the meaneſt Artiſans, and taken up as a livelyhood by Vagabonds,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100787:32"/>
and ſuch as are moſt ignorant and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. In the next place, many of thoſe who pretend to be Maſters of it, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly of a moroſe and untunable Nature themſelves, capricious and fantaſtical: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there is no perſon ſo ſimple and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous but will pretend to be a Judge of <hi>Muſick,</hi> and will cenſure the peformance. But all this while theſe are not the faults of the Art but of the Profeſſours of it, and by the ſame Reaſon <hi>Poetry</hi> might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd, becauſe it is profan'd by every Dogrel and Rhiming Ballad-maker; and <hi>Painting</hi> too, becauſe it is pretended to by every Dawber of a Sign-poſt. Though it be an Accompliſhment in a Gentleman to be well skill'd at an Inſtrument or Voice, and though he may make uſe of both for his own divertiſement, yet he ought to practice but rarely in Company, unleſs there be others of his own degree to bear a Part, for it comes too near Fidling to ſtrike up at anothers pleaſure, and to do it of ones own accord, unleſs it be amongſt familiar Friends, is affectation and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical: But above all, Princes and great Perſons ought to be careful not to ſpend much Time this way. <hi>Nero</hi> was an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Maſter, but by playing Publickly, was play'd upon by others. Much more diſcreet was the Emperour <hi>Alexander</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:100787:32"/>
                  <hi>Severus</hi> who Painted admirably, and Sang to Perfection, yet never entertain'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Practices of this kind, but when he was in private only, and amongſt his Pages.</p>
               <p>Of all ſorts of <hi>Muſick</hi> that is moſt graceful and diverting, where the Geſts of the Body correſpond to the Nature of the Air, and both to the Ditty and Argument, which I call Acting <hi>Muſick:</hi> For Singing is nothing but a more Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious way of ſpeaking, which when it is perform'd without too much breaking of the Voice, ſo that the Articulation of the words be not loſt, and being accompanied with a ſuitable and decent motion, it is moſt Charming, and this we rarely meet with but in <hi>Opera's,</hi> then which no ſhews under Heaven can be more Magnificent and pleaſing to the Senſes. To conclude, 'tis enough for a Gentleman if he perform his Part <hi>Alla Cavalareſca,</hi> looking upon <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick</hi> as a Remedy againſt oppreſſion of the Spirits, either by too much buſineſs, or by too little, which ever tends to ſolitude and <hi>Melancholy.</hi> Moreover <hi>Muſick</hi> is a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative againſt the Anger and fierceneſs of Nature, 'tis ſociable and exceeding help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Devotion; upon all which accounts it muſt be eſteem'd worthy a mans Study and Practice, and ought to be lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               </head>
               <p>THE Benefits which arrive to men by Travel are many; and firſt in reſpect of Communities or of a Nation in General. By this men are taught to know the way to Foreign Countries, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their Productions and Arts, and to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change their own Commodities, all which cannot but excite to Ingenuity and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and purchaſe Riches. By this we are taught to know the Strength and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of Forreign Princes, their Arts of Peace and War, with whatſoever concerns Civil Negotiations. By this the moſt remote Parts of the habitable World are linkt in bonds of Alliance, and by this we underſtand the Tranſactions of both the <hi>Indies,</hi> as well as of our Neighbour Nations. But to paſs by theſe Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I ſhall only Diſcourſe of Travel in
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100787:33"/>
relation to Individuals, and in relation to the benefit which every particular Perſon may reap unto himſelf, and firſt in reſpect of Health: for a man by accuſtoming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to different Climates and Seaſons, to different ſorts of Lodging and Dyet, to riſe early and to have his Body in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Exerciſe; I ſay, by ſuch like Methods as theſe (which are the ordinary Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Travellers,) he cannot but acquire a Robuſt Conſtitution, patient of fatigue, and fit for duties whether of Buſineſs or War, provided a man live temperately, for otherwiſe he will miſcarry in a State of the greateſt repoſe and eaſe, nay ſuch a ſtate is moſt apt to betray men to Exceſs and Surfet.</p>
               <p>But the Benefits which arrive from Travel are yet more conſiderable in reſpect of the Mind, eſpecially if the Perſon be under the Conduct of one who knows to introduce him into good Society: here by little and little he will be taught to wear off that Clowniſh Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, to which a home-bred Education does uſually expoſe him: Thoſe who are too ſheepiſh and baſhful, will by a dayly practice with new Perſons, and thoſe of different circumſtances of life, acquire a good Addreſs and Preſence. As for my young Maſter, the Hopes and Heir of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100787:34"/>
the Family, he is commonly ſuch a one, who knows no othér ſaces but thoſe of his Fathers Tenants, by whom he is Squir'd up and flatter'd, and where like a little Tyrant he ſwaggers without controul; but how ſoon will this poor Bubble be evaporated and blown away, when 'tis once expos'd to the open Air? His impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and impertinence ſerve only to make him Ridiculous and Scorn'd, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Corrected, till by farther progreſs, and often reprehenſions, as well from his own Reaſon as others Examples, he finds his Error, and by little and little alſo finds that if he will be acceptable, he muſt be Affable and Courteous. In a word, Travel teaches a Man to be able to ſuit himſelf with Perſons of all Conditions, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Laws of Civility, and what to give as well as what to challenge. And the views of Forreign Courts, Embaſſies, Habits and Ceremonies though never ſo tranſient, cannot chooſe but leave ſome traces upon his Mind, which will grow up with Nature and render him perfect and acceptable.</p>
               <p>Then for thoſe Gentiler Exerciſes, as of <hi>Muſick, Arms, Dancing, Riding</hi> the great Horſe, the Diſcipline of the <hi>Camp, Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> beſides <hi>Languages, Modes,</hi> with all the Airs and Ceremonies of Gallantry,

all theſe I ſay are learn'd abroad with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite more eaſe and leſs Expence than in a mans own Country. As for Towns, fine Houſes, Gardens, Inventions of Art, Antiquities, ſhews, with all the Ornaments and various Productions of Countries, as alſo the ſeveral Occurrences of a mans own or of anothers life, they are things which ſerve chiefly for Diſcourſe and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, and as a man will learn them infinitely better, and in a greater Meaſure from his own Obſervation, than from the reports of others; ſo what he ſees with his own Eyes will make a more durable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion than what he hears from others; and as they will procure a more favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble attention, ſo may he with better Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and Grace relate them too; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that one man does obſerve what ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does not, ſo cannot a man be ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure of the impartiality and diligence of another, as he is of what's preſented to his own Senſes.</p>
               <p>But it will be objected, That as there may be much Good learn'd abroad, ſo may a man learn much Evil, and Youth being naturally more prone to Liberty and Vice than to Virtue, the probability of being debaucht is greater than that of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed: We find this to be many times true, I confeſs, by too ſad Experience; but all
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100787:35"/>
this while have we not <hi>Courteſans</hi> and <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> at home, have we not our fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal home-bred <hi>Fops,</hi> whoſe Heads are of as light a ſraight as thoſe which come from beyond Sea loaden with Feathers? and have we not as many <hi>Gaming-houſes,</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly more <hi>Tipling-houſes</hi> which are the Nurſeries of Idleneſs and Sottiſhneſs, and the ruin of Health, Reputation and Eſtate? Drunkenneſs is ſcandalous in all parts of the World except <hi>Germany, Holland,</hi> and the Nothern Countries, to which few Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men repair for Breeding: and perhaps I ſhall not exceed, if I affirm that this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle vice of intemperance, to which we are ſo habitually addicted, is as miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to man as all the Debaucheries of other Countries put together. 'Tis no Diſparagement, but rather a Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fertility of the Ground, that it produces Poyſonous Plants as well as Medicinal: if a man inſtead of ſmelling to the Roſe will put his Noſe to the Prickle, he muſt blame his own fooliſh choice, not Nature. Thoſe who are of Virtuous diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions will reap much more benefit abroad than at home; others who are Vicious are many times reclaim'd by Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and if ſome few miſcarry, their loſs is not ſo conſiderable as the benefit which accrues to others.</p>

Whoſoever will Travel to purpoſe, ought to Travel twice; firſt in his Youth, for then is he moſt capable of learning Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and of improving himſelf by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe: afterwards in his maturer years, when youthful heats are ſpent, and all the Crudities of Nature digeſted, ſo that his Judgment being then ſtrong and vegete, he is able to diſtinguiſh betwixt Good and Evil, to underſtand men, and to correct former omiſſions. In this particular pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Perſons are happier than Princes, who living in Emulation cannot enter into one anothers Countries without leave, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps danger; beſides the greatneſs of their Quality carries too great a Train and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſs with it, and the Punctilio's of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony on which they ſtand, will not only make their Voyage very troubleſom, but will occaſion ſometimes great jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies and diſguſts. Nevertheleſs we may obſerve that ſuch of them as have Travell'd, have prov'd alſo the greateſt Hero's of their Age; and ſuch were <hi>Guſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus Adolphus, Solyman</hi> the Manificent, and <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, who made nine Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into <hi>Germany,</hi> ſix into <hi>Spain,</hi> ſeven into <hi>Italy,</hi> four into <hi>France,</hi> ten into the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> two into <hi>England,</hi> as many into <hi>Affrica,</hi> beſides eleven Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyages. 'Tis true; he did not this as a
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100787:36"/>
Traveller, but ſometimes as a Soldier at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with his Army, and ſometimes in purſuance of his Civil Affairs, which led him into diſtant Countries which were under his Dominion: Nevertheleſs 'tis not to be doubted, but that he gain'd great Experience thereby, and though his Son <hi>Philip</hi> were a Politick and wiſe Prince, yet being of a Sedentary and Thinking Nature, and conſequently managing all things by Lieutenants, he was leſs Proſperous, which coſt him no leſs than the Revolt of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> one of the faireſt Jewels in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Crown.</p>
               <p>There are two ſorts of Perſons equally abſurd in the Judgment they make of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel: The firſt are thoſe who cry up no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is Forreign, <hi>French</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>French</hi> Manufactures, <hi>French</hi> Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, <hi>French</hi> Phraſes, <hi>French</hi> Games, and perhaps <hi>French</hi> Diſeaſes. Others think they cannot ſhew themſelves true <hi>Engliſh</hi> but by crying up their own Country as the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the World, and by diſparaging all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and theſe for the moſt part underſtand little beyond a Pack of <hi>Dogs,</hi> a good piece of <hi>Beef,</hi> a Pipe of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> and a Barrel of <hi>Ale.</hi> But he who deſigns his own improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will judge impartially of what is good both at home and abroad, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly will make his choice, he will
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100787:36"/>
not be laviſh in commending the one, nor in undervaluing of the other.</p>
               <p>'Twas generouſly and prudently done of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who gave order for chooſing yearly out of both the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities ſeveral young Students, ſuch as were of hopeful Parts, and deſtitute of Fortune, whom ſhe maintain'd abroad out of the Revenues of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and took care alſo to diſpoſe of them after their return in ſuch Offices and Employments of Truſt, as might make them able to diſplay their Gifts, and to open a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to greater Fortunes: For though all could not be provided for, yet as in a Race where one obtains the Price, all notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding would ſet forwards with ſpeed, and by the courſe of Merit endeavour to be capable of obtaining Honour.</p>

               <p>HAving in the pecedent Diſcourſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a ſurvey of Man, as well in his firſt Production, as in his Growth and Education, it follows of courſe that we conſider him now in a ſtate of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, and as under a twofold per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Body and Mind: And firſt for the Perfection of his Body, it conſiſts in theſe three things, <hi>Health, Strength</hi> and <hi>Beauty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Health</hi> is not only in it ſelf one of the greateſt Bleſſings of Life, but 'tis ſuch a one too as gives life and ſenſe to all other Endearments whatſoever. We are leaſt ſenſible of this Bleſſing whilſt we enjoy it, for ſuch is the deprav'd guſt we have of things, that we underſtand their value more by the want than by the poſſeſſion of them. The Voluptuous man whilſt he is in the heigth of frolick and delight,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100787:37"/>
whilſt Nature is vigorous in all its functions, and his blood runs peaceably through eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Vein, never thinks of what he enjoys: He never conſiders how eaſy 'tis for him to forfeit his Felicity by the leaſt ſtart of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, and how difficult 'tis for him to recover it again; no, he thirſts after un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſted pleaſures, and is ſtill lanching for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and ſpreading wide his Arms to embrace freſh Contents, till at length his imaginary happineſs betrays him to real Miſery. One who melts under the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a Fever, or of (what's more ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dangerous) the diſtemper'd flames of Love, finds little comfort in Treats and Viſits, in rich Cloaths, Furniture and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, nor in the more innocent Sports and Recreations of the Field. All thoſe Objects with which he formerly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd himſelf, do but help to aggravate his Miſery by informing him how ſhort and empty they were in compariſon of health, or if he has any remaining inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for them, 'twill be a Torment to him to find them preſent to his imagination, and he himſelf to be out of the reach of enjoying them: ſuch a one would readily exchange conditions with the meaneſt Peaſant, who lives by the ſweat of his Brows, to whom Labour gives not only Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, but the ſweeteſt repoſe and reſt, both
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100787:38"/>
which are the Eſſential parts of Health.</p>
               <p>But paſſing by theſe Moral reflexions, if we conſider Health in that Natural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation it has to man in his flouriſhing Age, we ſhall find it to be determined in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular obſervance of theſe following Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, <hi>viz.</hi> Air, Exerciſe, Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Repletion, Sleep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to all which whoſoever lives with due regard, cannot but enjoy one of the greateſt Gifts in Nature. They who are bleſt with great Health of Body, are not always men of the longeſt life; for preſuming upon the ſtrength of Nature, they run into many diſorders and exceſſes, whereas others of a more delicate Conſtitution ſtanding al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways upon their Guard, avoid the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Irregularity and Intemperance. Nevertheleſs the rule is good, that men ſhould by little and little accuſtom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſmall irregularities, ſuch as eating at all hours, and of Meats leſs curiouſly prepar'd: alſo expoſing ones ſelf to all ſorts of Weather, to hard Lodging, Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, thin Cloathing, with many other inequalities to which men of buſineſs are obnoxious: for he who lives by Weight and Meaſure, when Action calls him forth of Doors is preſently overtaken with diſorder; every ſtorm of Rain, or an hours Riding in the Night, is able to make him ſend for
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100787:38"/>
the Phyſitian, who will be ſure to purge his Purſe as well as his Body.</p>
               <p>It has been obſerv'd that men have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been moſt healthful where there have been feweſt Phyſicians: whether it be that the healthfulneſs of the Country be a diſcouragement to their Practice, or that the want of them be the cauſe of Health I ſhall not determine. Certain 'tis, that they are not to be recours'd to but in caſes of Extremity, ſince the Medicines by which Nature is aſſiſted, are for the moſt part compounded of many Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of different qualities, ſo that any ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of their Virtues, any defect in the mixture, or any Error in the Application, is able to put Nature into great diſorder. Or let the Application be never ſo exact and rational, yet there will remain ſome dregs of Heterogeneous parts, which will ſtill he lurking in the Body, and will be ever and anon breaking forth into new Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But then the caſe is much more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, when we conſider the uncertainties upon which this Art is founded, <hi>viz.</hi> our ignorance of the Frame and Fabrick of the Body, as alſo the Functions of each Organ in relation to Nutrition, Senſe and Life, together with our ignorance of the Age, Temperament, Courſe of life, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100787:39"/>
Circumſtances of every individual perſon. And the difficulty will ſtill encreaſe, when we call to Mind the alterations and percolations which Medicines undergo in the Body, as alſo the Obſtructions they will meet with before they can arrive to the part affected, to which we may add alſo our great ignorance of the Nature of moſt Diſeaſes, of their Cauſes, Progreſs and Effects: all therefore which Phyſick can pretend to, is at the beſt, but Conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or Empirical; but when the whole Management of Health and Life, falls into the hands of ſome ignorant Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker, (and ſuch they are generally who pretend to this Faculty) what real dangers muſt then attend the miſerable and diſeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed party? The Art therefore of preſerving Health is much more to be valued than that of reſtoring it; beſides, 'tis more eaſy and ſecure, as being in every mans peculiar Power.</p>

               <p>STrength is another Perfection belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Man's Body, which tho it be not of ſuch Importance as the former, is of great account nevertheleſs, being one of thoſe Excellencies with which Angelical Natures are Endued, they being above all Creatures eminent for Activity and Power. There is a twofold Strength; the firſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary: This conſiſts in Men, Money, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline, Conduct and Counſel, for by theſe Means Empire is both acquir'd and enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; but Strength of Government goes fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for tho Conqueſts may be made by Force, yet they will never ſettle into Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, but by a free Commerce, ſound Counſels, and a faithful Adminiſtration of Juſtice, with many other things relating to Civil Oeconomy. There is alſo another Strength of the Body Natural, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a healthful Conſtitution, and a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100787:40"/>
ſtrong and compact Formation of Muſcles, Bones, and Sinews: That which conſiſts in brawny Members, and in a bulky Maſs of Body, is leſs to be accounted of, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing natural to the baſer ſort, ſuch as La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, Porters, and generally to all Men of Drudgery. Paſſive Strength, or to be able to undergo Fatigue, is that, to which Perſons, even of the beſt Character, ought to be accuſtom'd: But the active Strength, which conſiſts in Nimbleneſs and Vigor, is moſt Ornamental, and was in greateſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation amongſt the Greeks, as appears from their Inſtitution of the <hi>Olympick Games,</hi> where Youths of the beſt Quality and Extraction, did uſually contend with one another, and ſtrive for Victory. As for the <hi>Romans,</hi> they had ſuch Exerciſes in leſs Eſteem: For Wraſtlings and Combats, whether betwixt Men and Men, or betwixt Men and Beaſts, were the Employments only of Slaves, or of condemn'd Perſons, or of ſuch as were Mercenary; ſo that all the Uſe they made of them, was only to entertain the Spectators with Paſtime and Divertiſement; and even at this Day, thoſe who are moſt eminent in this Kind, are generally Infamous, ſuch as Rope-Dancers, Tumblers, common Wraſtlers, Sword-Players, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet it is commendable in a Gentleman, or any Perſon of civil
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100787:40"/>
Quality, to be able to Run, Wraſtle, Vault, and to uſe his Weapon with Strength and Addreſs; nay ſuch Abilities may ſometimes be of great Benefit and Advantage: But for ſuch a one to make ſhew of them, or to ſet a Value upon himſelf for theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, is Vain and Ridiculous, as the frequent uſe of them is many times Dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and a ſhortner of Mans Life: For we may frequently obſerve that thoſe who in their Youthful Days were moſt Luſty and Active, are more Broken and Decrepit in their old Age than other Men, by reaſon of the many Blows, Bruiſes, and Surfets, which uſually attend ſuch Violent Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes.</p>
               <p>Strength therefore is an excellent Gift of Nature, if it be rightly manag'd, and beſides the Succours it gives a Man in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Rencounters of his Life, 'tis a Badg alſo of Royalty, when 'tis Accompanied with Courage, upon which account the <hi>Eagle</hi> amongſt Birds, and the Lyon amongſt Beaſts, challenge the Soveraignty.</p>
               <p>I doubt not but that in the firſt Herd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Mankind into Troops and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, he who was the Strongeſt and Stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Fellow amongſt them, obtained the Rule over all the reſt; Men being natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught to ſubmit to him, who was moſt able to Hurt and to Protect them, which
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100787:41"/>
thing alſo we ſee even at this Day amongſt the <hi>Indians.</hi> 'Tis true, this Method was not of any long Continuance, for there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infinite Numbers of Men, who were all equally Confident of their own Strength of Body, they thought they had as good a right to Rule as others, from whence aroſe perpetual Fightings, Robberies, and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, not only betwixt Company and Company, but amongſt thoſe alſo who were of the ſame Gang; all which tending to the Ruine of Man-kind, and to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Subverſion of Society, Men at laſt were forc'd for their own Preſervation, and by common Conſent, to circumſcribe Power by ſuch Laws as had the greateſt Regard to the common Good, and were to be of greater Validity, and of a longer Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance than Might.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>Of Beauty.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE laſt Perfection belonging to the Body is Beauty, whoſe Conqueſts are more Univerſal then thoſe of Strength, for what this cannot Subdue by Force, the other doth Win by Surrender. Beauty, if it be not accompanied with other Virtues, is but like a fair Sign to an ill Inn, it may invite Strangers to enter in, but as ſoon as they find the bad Entertainment and the ill Furniture of the Place, they will quickly quit ſo ill an Habitation: And yet we find that this is the Goddeſs which moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, as did the <hi>Trojan</hi> Youth of old, who preferred her before Wiſdom and Honour. All the Words and Actions of a handſome Woman, ſeem to have a Charm; all Men admire ſuch a perſon upon the firſt Sight, and as they have Opportunities of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, they will not fail to Cajole her by Flatteries, and to Commend her Wit in the moſt Luſhious and Inſinuating Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100787:42"/>
they can Invent. But when once the Flower begins to wither, and Beauty to Decay, then is it that ſhe ſeems to be degraded beneath the Qualifications of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Her mimical and wanton Geſts, her affected Liſpings, her pretty Repartees and modiſh Words, her turnings up of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Lips, and the windings of the Neck, not forgetting the languiſhing, or rather, the half opening Eyes, together with her Stories of Faſhions, of Romances, of Amours, and of the Court, will then look moſt wretchedly Bald and Antique, and when ſuch Perſons by a long Habit, ſhall become unable or unwilling to leave this artificial Beauty, they muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be expos'd alſo to Laughter and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
               <p>Beauty of Body doth conſiſt of three Parts; Complexion, Feature, and Shape, and laſtly, a graceful Motion or Addreſs. Complexion or colour of Skin is of little Value, it being eaſy to be loſt, and as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy to be counterfeited: It may be bought in the Shops for ſix Pence, and may be ſold again face and all for as little, ſaving that the Purchaſer many times pays a dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er price for what is given him in the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Shape and Feature are nobler parts of Beauty, which cannot be counterfeited by Art, and are therefore Real, nor can
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100787:42"/>
they be defaced but by old Age, and are therefore Solid. But above all, a graceful Preſence and Addreſs is the abſolute Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of Beauty, as reſulting from many excellent Qualities of the Mind, ſuch as Courage, Bounty, Affability, Modeſty, and willingneſs to Oblige, all which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centring in the Mind, and being lodg'd in a Body generouſly Born, and of excellent Shape, create a Harmony, and by ſome ſecret Emanations ſend forth their Rays, and give a Luſture through all parts of the Body. This indeed is a piece of Beauty which is really magnetick, which charms Men, and is alſo durable and Heroick: It is a piece of Beauty which the Pencils of the beſt Artiſts can rarely Expreſs. A Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity and Serenity of Looks, the Airs of Motion, together with the ſweet Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations and Cadencies of the Voyce, are the three Perfections under which true Beauty is defin'd, ſuch as are really diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult (if not impoſſible) to be ſhadow'd out by Colours, and muſt be acknowledged therefore to have a Reſemblance with ſomething that is Celeſtial and Divine.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, this ſort of Beauty is in ſome meaſure Artificial, as being acquir'd very much by Breeding and Imitation; but for all this, we ſee that ſome Perſons are ſo faſhioned by Birth, that whatſoever
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100787:43"/>
they ſay or do carries with it ſuch a Native Grace and Elegance, as gains Applauſe with all Men. They ſpeak with their Eyes, and being ſilent perſwade. This Beauty therefore of Preſence and Motion, has much the Advantage above the Airs of Feature and Complexion; for we ſhall rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee many Perſons to agree in the ſame Opinion of a handſome Face, one diſlikes the Noſe, another the Lips, a third the Eyes, and ſo on, ſo that Feature and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion are only relative Perfections, and are only deem'd Beautiful, ſo far as they bear a Conformity to the Fancy: Now the Fancies of Men being always different and Irregular, there muſt be the ſame Inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the things they Meaſure; whereas the Beauty of Behavior and Addreſs, is A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable to all, it Reconciles every thing it meets with to its ſelf, which ſhews that it reaches further than the Imagination, and penetrates to the Soul, which is a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple far more permanent and ſolid. Upon this Account alſo 'tis, that even Deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Body, where it is not accompanied with Obliquity of Manners, becomes leſs Offenſive, the more we are acquainted with it; and Beauty of Body, deſtitute of Wit and good Humour, the more we Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with it, the leſs it becomes Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: for the Mind of Man, into which all
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100787:43"/>
things enter leiſurely and by degrees, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Spiritual, Subtle, and Diſcerning Nature, cannot take up its Repoſe with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing but what is ſuitable to its ſelf. This Correſpondence therefore of Mind meeting in ſome common Inclinations of Nature, is that which makes an intimate and laſting Union betwixt Perſons, and creates Harmony and Beauty.</p>
               <p>Perſons who are leſs Beautiful, amongſt the many Arts they have to ſet off them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, think it not the leaſt to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to Deformity it ſelf, as to a Foil, which will render an ordinary Face accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. Beauty of Body, as it is relative, and bears reſpect for the moſt part, to the Opinion of the Beholder, ſo alſo is it but a Comparative Excellence: For <hi>Janus-like,</hi> it hath two Faces, with one of which it looks towards ſomething worſe than it ſelf, in reſpect whereof it may be denominated Beauty; with the other Face it looks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſomething which is above it, which is more curiouſly faſhion'd, or as they ſay, more divinely made, in reſpect whereof 'twill paſs only for a thing common and indifferent; ſo that of two Perſons ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, if one of them be more Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and Brillant, the other will ſeem more Vulgar and Inconſiderable, like as in the Arms of a Ballance, where the raiſing of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100787:44"/>
one muſt be by the depreſſion of the other: 'Tis prudently done therefore of thoſe in whom the Gifts of Nature are leſs Orient, to have their Blacks always at their El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow.</p>
               <p>And yet for all this, Deformity many times is even with Beauty: For where the former cannot advance it ſelf to the Eſteem and Reputation of the latter, it will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour notwithſtanding, to pull it down to its own Pitch and Level, I mean by Deſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, for it is quick-ſighted enough ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſpy Blemiſhes of another kind, or Malicious enough to invent them; and this holds good not only in Competition about natural Endowments, but alſo where one Perſon has the advantage above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, either in Civil Employments, or in the Favours of Fortune. Upon this account alſo 'tis obſerv'd by the Learn'd Lord <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulam,</hi> that deform'd Perſons are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bold and witty: Bold in their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as being expos'd to Scorn, from which they will ſeek to free themſelves, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Virtue or Malice, both which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſome degrees of Wit in the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 'Twould be good therefore for Perſons who are obnoxious this way, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin firſt to Jeer themſelves, and Droll upon their own Defects, which would be a good Diſappointment to anothers De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100787:44"/>
of doing the ſame: For there can no Wit be ſhown in ſaying the ſame thing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again, eſpecially when I muſt be oblig'd for it, to the Fancy of him whom I intend to play upon. In fine, the beſt Remedy for one who is adorn'd with the Gifts of Nature, not to be envied, is not to deſpiſe another who is deform'd; for as Envy is natural to the latter, ſo Pride oftentimes accompanies the former. Youth, Strength, and Beauty, are proper to Angelical Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for as much as the Excellencies of theſe glorious Creatures are uſually painted and repreſented to our groſſer Capacities, under the appearances of ſuch material Forms; and yet ſuch was the Deformity of Pride, that it converted theſe glorious Creatures into hideous Devils: Whoſoever then would be Angel-like, let him joyn Humility and Sweetneſs of Nature to the forementioned Bleſſings of the Body.</p>
               <p>There is a Beauty alſo of bruit Animals, amongſt which thoſe are eſteem'd to have it moſt, which are moſt ſwift and Nimble, ſuch as <hi>Grey-Hounds, Deer, Horſes, Cats,</hi> and the like, ſo that Aptneſs of Motion ſeems to go a great way in the Definition of Beauty.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>Of the Dependency of the Soul on the Animal Faculties.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Soul is to the Body, as the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el is to the Cabinet: The Cabinet we ſee is many times Embelliſhed with great variety of Colours, and wrought with curious Artifice, but its Beauty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only Superficial, Men care not to dwell long in the Admiration of it, eſpecially when they are to have a ſight of the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es which are within. Upon this Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration I have given but a tranſitory Glance at the outward or Ornamental part of Man, as being that which firſt offers it ſelf to Sight, the Body: That which is more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy our fixt Admiration, is the Jewel it contains, a Jewel of ineſtimabl Value, the Soul, which tho it enjoy an abſolute Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in its own Nature, yet when it is in a State of Conjunction, as the School-men ſpeak, it is very much influenc'd, and in a manner determin'd by the Inclinations of the inferior Animal Faculty, not only as
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100787:45"/>
to the Individuality, but alſo as to the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification of its Actions; that is to ſay, the Body as it is the Subject of Life and Senſe, doth not only contribute its Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Soul in the forming of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and internal Act, but doth very much diſpoſe it as to what ſort and kinds of Acts it ſhall apply its Power, and this not only in matters of Morality which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard the Will, but ſometimes in matters of Thought and Study, ſuch as have rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Underſtanding.</p>
               <p>Since therefore the Actions of Man do follow the Paſſions of the Mind, and theſe the Temper and Diſpoſition of the Body, whoſoever would diſcourſe rationally of the former, ought to enquire into and ſurvey the Conſtitutions of the latter. Let us run over all the Circumſtances of Life, let us view the Varieties of every Age of Man, together with the ſeveral Diſpoſitions of Climates and Countries, and we may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily obſerve that Nature doth always act in Conformity to this Principle. The Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Deſires of Childhood are not the ſame with thoſe of maturer Years, nor thoſe of maturer Years the ſame with thoſe of old Age. The moiſt and tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of Youth, like the Virgin Wax, are capable to receive any Impreſſion, and as apt to loſe it. Its Nature is Fluid and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100787:46"/>
Unconſtant, prone to Pleaſure, and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of Hardſhip and Delay. Men of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Years, ſtanding as it were in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Region of Life, and comparing things preſent with paſt and future, form their Actions accordingly, and can eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with preſent Wants and Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the large returns of Time and Expectation: They can ſmother leſs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments, and diſſemble Fears upon a Proſpect of Intereſt and Gain.</p>
               <p>And as in the ſeveral Ages of Man, ſo is it in the difference of Climates, that Mens Propenſities are determined eaſily, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Temperament of the Air and Region in which they live. They who inhabit the low Countries, are of a groſſer Diſpoſition, and of a more bulky Frame: Their Spirits move heavily, being charg'd with too much Humour and Repletion: This makes them more difficult to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, but where they do attempt, they are indefatigable in the Purſuit, and Reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of what they learn. This we ſee moſt apparently in the <hi>Dutch,</hi> in whom the want of more refin'd Spirits is abundantly ſupplied by Induſtry: They move but flowly, yet they are patient of Fatigue both in Councel and Commerce, and in matters of Learning, tho their Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not ſo gentile and poliſh'd, they
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100787:46"/>
are nevertheleſs uſeful, and by their great Collections and variety of Readings, with which their bulky Volums ſwell, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to the World their invincible Conſtancy in what they undertake. Thoſe who inhabit the colder Clime, are forc'd to ſupply the Defects of Heat with Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which cannot but expoſe them to Beſtiality and Indiſcretion, and muſt have a great influence upon their Moral, as well as upon their Natural Capacities. Hence it is, that tho they are generally quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and expoſed to all the Effects of Sottiſhneſs and Intemperance, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they are leſs Revengeful, at once diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging both their Surfeit and their Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. That freedom and openneſs of Thought which accompanies their Drinking, makes them uncapable to Conceal or Premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate any thing againſt the Government, as we ſee in the <hi>Germans,</hi> who notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Intemperance, and the infinite number of little Principalities, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that mixture and confuſion of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, and the variety of Religions which are amongſt them, live in better Accord with one another, and with a more regular Subjection to their Superiors, than others of their Neighbours who are more refin'd, which <hi>Boccatin</hi> very ingeniouſly obſerves in the Defence they made before
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100787:47"/>
the Tribunal of <hi>Apollo.</hi> The Inhabitants of Ilands are generally more Rebellious and Unconſtant than thoſe who live upon the Continent, witneſs <hi>Brittain, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Sicily.</hi> We may obſerve the like Diverſity of others, as to Morals and Politicks, from the reſpect they have to the Heaven under which they live. Thoſe of a dry and hot Country are born with quicker Witts than others, and obliged to greater regularity of Life, from the Dangers and Diſeaſes which are derivable from Heat accompanied with Exceſs.</p>
               <p>Thus much is true in the general: But if we deſcend to Particulars, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Obſervation further, and ſhew, that the Bent and Inclination of every Man's Life, doth hold Analogy with the individual Craſis and Conſtitution of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: There are ſome 'tis true, who go farther and aſſert; that from the Anatomy of the Brain a Man may demonſtrate the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the Paſſions, and diſcern the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Springs and firſt reſorts of the Soul, but thoſe are but Chimera's, the Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Impertinence, or an ingenious Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Was there ever Man that could aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the Cells of Anger or Love, of Joy and Sorrow? Or could he ſhew their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Figures and Dimenſions, and by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Diſſection of the Brain diſcover which
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100787:47"/>
was a wiſe Man, and which a Fool; from the different Traces left upon it? Nor is this Theory only ridiculous, but deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive alſo to the fundamental Articles of Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> The Souls Immortality, and the Liberty of the Will: For tho it be true, that in Bruits all things move in a certain Tenour, and as it were by Impulſe, as it happens in a Watch, where the Wheels are ſet in order, and the Springs wound up; nevertheleſs, ſo great is the variety of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in a Rational Soul, ſo ſublime are its Speculations, and ſo predominant its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves above all the Reports and Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Senſe, as ſhews ſufficiently that there is a Faculty in Man independent on it, and tho it be oftentimes inclin'd by it, yet is it able to diſengage it ſelf, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe a ſoveraign Authority over Nature<hi>:</hi> Whereas thoſe who aſſert the contrary, do not only involve themſelves in palpable Abſurdities, but do deny the very Exiſtence of their own Souls, when they define all the Faculties of it to be nothing but a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Animal Spirits proportion'd to ſome certain Organs and Inſtruments, all which are annihilated by Death. This then is true, that every Man has a power deriv'd from his own Soul to controul the Motions of Nature, but then 'tis true too, that this muſt be Underſtood only in Men
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100787:48"/>
of a Maſculine and of a diſciplin'd Reaſon. Moſt incline to Nature, and chooſe the Methods which Paſſion does propoſe; nay even in Intellectual Operations, and in matters of Opinion, how willing are we to delude our ſelves being byaſſed by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and that Intereſt accommodated only to Senſe and preſent enjoyments.</p>
               <p>But to leave humane Actions whether Intellectual or Moral, let us conſider thoſe which are Natural, I mean the Paſſions, of which 'tis certain beyond all diſpute and queſtion, that they depend entirely upon the Diſpoſition of the Body. No ſooner does an Object ſtrike upon the Eye, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but the Image is conveigh'd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the common Store-houſe of the Senſes, the Imagination, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly as it appears agreeable or diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, ſo does the Imagination make the impreſſion upon the Animal Spirits, which with imperceptible quickneſs and ſubtlety are tranſmitted by the <hi>Nerves</hi> to the Parts principally concern'd, and excite Motions of deſire or diſlike, with all the Train of Actions ſubſequent thereto; if we make an Impreſſion on the Water by caſting in a Stone, or upon the Air by ſtriking of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Bodies together, we find a kind of Undulation, by which as by a ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of multiplied Impreſſions, the Image
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100787:48"/>
is conveigh'd to a conſiderable diſtance faſter, or ſlower as the Medium is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd. 'Tis the ſame in our Bodies as to the Images of Senſe, though it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd after a manner, which is far more quick and delicate; hence it is, that as men live with more or leſs Regularity and Temperance, their Senſes are more or leſs refin'd to receive the Images of things, and in Conformity hereunto the Paſſions move with greater or leſs juſtneſs and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>Theſe Conſiderations being premis'd, I come now to diſcourſe upon the Actions of the Mind, as they fall under theſe two Grand Faculties of the Soul, the Will and the Underſtanding; and becauſe both theſe Faculties receive their Informations from certain Inſtruments, I ſhall in the firſt place inquire into the Nature and Conſtitution of theſe Inſtruments, and they are either External, contain'd under the five Senſes, or Internal, <hi>viz.</hi> Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Memory.</p>

               <p>ONE who is confin'd to a cloſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in which are ſome few Chinks, only for the conveyance of Light and Air, though he may have an ability to ſee all the variety of Objects which are in Nature, notwithſtanding this can actually diſcern no more, than what lies directly oppoſite to the ſtraight paſſages of the Walls, in which he is impriſon'd. Juſt ſo the Soul of Man is confin'd to the Body as to a cloſe Chamber or Priſon, from whence it happens, that though it be capable in its own Nature, of knowing all things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Compaſs or Sphere of Creatures, yet it falls out, that whilſt it is in this ſtate of Confinement, all the informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it can receive of what's tranſacted in Nature, is conveighed to it by thoſe nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Paſſages or Caſements of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; ſo that were it once delivered from this impriſonment, and expos'd to the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100787:49"/>
open day, it would then be able to take one great Proſpect of all the wonders and glorious Objects of Heaven and Earth, with which this World is beautified.</p>
               <p>Of the five Senſes, three ſerve more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately for the Operations of Nature and Life, <hi>viz. Feeling, Taſting</hi> and <hi>Smelling;</hi> the other two <hi>viz. Seeing</hi> and <hi>Hearing</hi> are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to the Operations of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: For ſo it was, that men by the Inſtinct of Nature were firſt taught to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs themſelves and their Conceptions of things by certain Articulate Sounds, which by the help of Art were afterwards form'd into Words. Now theſe Words if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Letters or Characters of which they are Compounded, do repreſent the things contain'd in them by the Senſe of <hi>Seeing,</hi> but if we conſider them with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Organs of Speech, and the Sounds they make in the Pronounciation, they conveigh their ſignification to us by the Senſe of <hi>Hearing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we conſider the Senſes altogether, perhaps man enjoys them all in as great perfection as any particular Creature what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever: but if we conſider them apart, as they are to be found in ſeveral ſort of Animals, 'tis certain there are many of them which have their Senſes more acute and per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 chunk">
                     <desc>…</desc>
                  </gap>t than Man. Birds, eſpecially
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100787:50"/>
thoſe of Prey, as <hi>Hawks, Eagles,</hi> and the like, are of wonderful Sight, whether we conſider the diſtance at which they ſee, or the ſuddain diſcovery they make of Objects, or laſtly their great force and ſtrength in looking againſt the Light of the <hi>Sun.</hi> Alſo Birds and Beaſts of Prey, being ſuch as feed on Fleſh are wonderful ſagacious in their Smell. It is reported of <hi>Eagles,</hi> that after a Battle they have ſmelt the Carkaſſes at a hundred miles diſtance, and have come the next day from all Quarters to feed upon the dead Bodies, which they could not poſſibly do were they not guided to it by their Scent, for they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver flock together but upon ſuch occaſions of Prey. I once Diſſected a Dog, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving waſht my hands very clean, and whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my Knife bright, being at Supper ſome hours after, I offer'd a <hi>Grey-hound</hi> ſome meat from my Plate, which ſmelling to he refus'd and went away though he were at that time very hungry. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why Birds and Beaſt of Prey are more acute in the ſenſe of Smelling, proceeds from the extraordinary heat and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Spirits, with which theſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are repleniſh'd, ſo that they require a groſſer Nutriment and frequent Supplies; though it be true with all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have their Senſes moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cute when
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100787:50"/>
they are faſting, if it be not too exceſſive, for in ſuch caſes Nature grows weak and languiſhing. Now that Creatures when they are hungry ſhould have their Senſes more acute than at other times, is plain; for in a ſtate of Repletion the Spirits are clouded with ſuch groſs Vapours, as riſe from the Stomack to the Brain, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Senſe, by which means their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is retarded, and from which incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience they are never more free than in a ſtate of faſting and abſtinence. Now becauſe Beaſts of Prey by reaſon of their extraordinary heat endure hunger with greateſt impatience; therefore is it, that their Senſes are more vigorous and acute whilſt they are under that neceſſity.</p>
               <p>If there be any Senſe in which man has the Preheminence above other Creatures, 'tis that of <hi>Hearing,</hi> though in the Senſe of <hi>Seeing</hi> as well as in the other of <hi>Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> he has this advantage, that he makes the Objects of both theſe Senſes, to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of conveighing Rational Notions to the Mind, by the help of words either ſpoke or written (as I have already noted) which is the chifeſt means by which Knowledge is propagated. This muſt certainly be acknowledg'd to be a great priviledge of our Nature, and ſuch to which no other Creature, though never
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100787:51"/>
ſo ſagacious can ever arrive to. For though <hi>Elephants</hi> and <hi>Dogs</hi> are very docible, yet they can never be brought to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſignification of Letters in any degree, and for words ſpoken 'tis very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle which they underſtand alſo, being taught with great patience and difficulty to perform ſome few Motions upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain words of Command. 'Tis wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to conſider how Nature in many caſes provides for our Neceſſities, making one Senſe to ſupply the Defects and Wants of another. I have ſeen ſome who being born Deaf, and conſequently Dumb, have notwithſtanding been extraordinary Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious in ſpeaking by Signs: by the quick motions of their Eyes they would pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into anothers Thoughts, and by the nimble motion of their fingers expreſs their own. I once ſaw a Gentleman who by ſome accident became Deaf, yet had his Senſe of <hi>Feeling</hi> ſo accurate, that by laying his hand only upon the Table in a Room, where was a Conſort of Muſick, he would diſtinguiſh the Meaſures of the Air, and would tell frequently what Tune was play'd.</p>
               <p>There are many caſes in which our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes may be deluded: I ſhall inſtance only in that of <hi>Seeing,</hi> which yet of all others
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100787:51"/>
ſeems leaſt ſubject to be deceiv'd. Now the Deception of the Sight proceeds from ſome of theſe Cauſes; as firſt, the Indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Organ: to thoſe who have the <hi>Jaundice</hi> all thing ſeem <hi>Yellow,</hi> and to others who are over-taken with Drink, the light ſeem double. Men that are in a <hi>Fever</hi> imagine they ſee Birds, Beaſts, and Flowers exactly drawn upon the Curtains of their Beds; and any violent Blow upon the Eye repreſents ſparks of Fire. A ſecond cauſe of the Deception of the Sight pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from ſome alteration of the <hi>Medium:</hi> when the Air is thick and Foggy, Objects ſeem much bigger than the Natural, but when it is ſerene they are ſeen far more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly and at a greater diſtance. By the reflection and refraction alſo of Images and Light, things are repreſented alſo in the Air, inſomuch that the Images of a few Horſemen have been multiplied into Armies, as we ſee the Image of one man by the reflection of two Glaſſes may be multipled into a Multitude. Sometimes we ſeem to ſee three or four <hi>Suns</hi> or <hi>Moons</hi> at once, all which are ſo alike that 'tis hard to diſtinguiſh the true one from the falſe. The <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> at their riſing and ſetting are five thouſand Miles more remote from our ſight, then when they are at their <hi>Meridian,</hi> and yet they ſeem
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100787:52"/>
twice as big at their riſing or ſetting, as they do when they are directly over us. The reaſon is from the refraction of their Beams through the many Vapours and Exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which be betwixt the <hi>Horizon</hi> and our ſight, which are far more groſs, and poſſeſs a thouſand times more ſpace than thoſe which be betwixt our ſight and the upper Region of the Air above us: Should a man who was born blind be ſuddainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to ſight, he would doubtleſs believe the Images which he ſaw in a Mirrour to be a ſolid Subſtance, in the ſame manner as other Creatures judge which act only by Senſe, as we ſee alſo in little Children. The <hi>Dog</hi> thought it had been real Fleſh he ſaw, when he caught at the Shadow of it in the Water. A third Cauſe of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Sight, is the diſproportionate diſtance of the Object; hence it is, that the <hi>Stars</hi> which many times exceed the <hi>Earth</hi> in bigneſs, ſeem to us no bigger than the ſparklings of a flame; Towns which lie in the ſame line ſeem many times contiguous, though they lye a mile or more aſunder, and Clouds alſo at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſeem like Rocks or Mountains. Nay in Objects with which we dayly do Converſe, and where there is no defect of <hi>Organ</hi> or <hi>Medium,</hi> or of any undue diſtance, I much doubt whether two Perſons looking upon
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100787:52"/>
the ſame Object do not many times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive very different impreſſions from it: and my reaſon's this: The great Object of Sight is Colour, and Colour being nothing but a certain refraction or reflection of Light mixt with Shadow, there will diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Colours ariſe as the Light falls vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly upon the ſame Object; ſo that two perſons looking upon it in different Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and by different degrees of Light, it muſt appear to them under different Colours, a thing to which Painters have a ſpecial regard. And to evince this Point thoroughly, I ſhall only propoſe two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. The one is this; let a Man match two Colours never ſo exactly by Candle Light, they ſhall appear another thing by the Light of the <hi>Sun.</hi> Another Inſtance is this; Take any Stuff Red or Blew for the purpoſe, and look upon it by the Sun-light, and afterwards hold the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Sun</hi> and the Eye, and it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear of a far more Orient Tincture by a refracted than by a reflected Light. From all which and a thouſand other Inſtances of this Nature, it appears that the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of any one ſingle Senſe may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonſtrative and fallacious. The cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain way therefore to judge of the reality of a thing, is when ſeveral perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in the ſame judgment of it, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100787:53"/>
when the Truth of its Exiſtence is made out to more Senſes than one. Thus the Truth of our Saviours Reſurrection was confirm'd not only by the Senſe of <hi>Seeing,</hi> but by thoſe others of <hi>Hearing</hi> and <hi>Feeling;</hi> and this too, not with reguard to one indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Perſon, but to many who ſaw him and convers'd with him at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>'Tis a Maxime in Philoſophy, That the Operations of the Underſtanding do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon thoſe of Senſe, which may be underſtood two ways. <hi>Firſt</hi> That the Intellect does in its actual Exerciſe depend immediately upon Senſe: Or, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it does mediately depend on Senſe; in as much as the firſt Notion it had of things, were Originally derived from the informations of Senſe. If we interpret the Maxime the former way 'tis certainly falſe, for ſo far is the Intellect from a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon Senſe in the actual Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of its Faculties, that there is nothing which does obſtruct it in its Functions more than theſe outward Objects with which we do Converſe. Upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Underſtanding is never more employ'd in the ſearch of Truth, then when it is in profound Silence, and actually withdrawn from all things ſenſible, which like ſo many Meſſengers are always ready to diſturb it by freſh reports. But if we
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100787:53"/>
interpret the Maxime in the later ſenſe, it is moſt true: But then 'tis as true alſo that thoſe firſt Informations or Rudiments of Senſe, have no more reſemblance with the Maſculine Inferences and Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Reaſon, than the Letters of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet, which are alſo the firſt Rudiments of Speech, have a reſemblance with the ſublime Orations of <hi>Tully</hi> or <hi>Demoheſtnes.</hi> From what has hitherto been ſaid, ſome infer, that the force of demonſtration can have no greater certainty than the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſenſe, our Senſes being as it were the firſt Principles upon which the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding proceeds to act. Now the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Senſe being prov'd in many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to be fallacious and uncertain, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions of Reaſon how demonſtrative ſc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may ſeem to be, muſt needs be uncertain alſo. To this I anſwer; that this Proportion, for inſtance [a line of four Inches is twice as long as a line of two inches] is as certain and demonſtrative as any in the World: for though my ſenſe might err in ſome Obſervation when it firſt repreſented the figure of a line to my underſtanding, nevertheleſs the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is of an unalterable verity, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing built not upon the Image of a line as it was at firſt drawn upon my Mind, but upon that Principle of Proportion by which
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100787:54"/>
all the Parts taken together are equal to the whole, which is a firſt Principle, ſuch as is born with our Natures, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent upon any antecedent diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Senſe.</p>
               <p>Senſation may be deſcrib'd after this manner. The Image of an Object arriving to the Organ of Senſe, it makes the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon the <hi>Nerves</hi> which are there terminated for that uſe, each of which is ſo Curiouſly form'd, and is of ſuch a certain ſpecifick Contexture as makes it capable only to receive the Images belonging to ſome one particular Senſe, as for inſtance of <hi>Seeing, Feeling, Hearing,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Nerves</hi> are the Channels wherein the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits which are of an Etherial ſubſtance next to Spiritual, are running always up and down with a moſt impetuous and ſubtile Motion. Now the <hi>Nerves</hi> termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating in the Brain as in their Centre, the Spirits alſo which are the Vehicles of all ſenſible Images do by the guidance of the ſame <hi>Nerves</hi> convey theſe Images to the <hi>Brain</hi> alſo where they all meet as in one common Receptacle.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>MEmory</hi> is a Noble Branch of the Soul, and one of the Principal Internal Inſtruments of the Underſtanding as well as of the Will. 'Tis like a faithful Steward to whom the immenſe Treaſure of Images is committed, all which it receives by the Miniſtry and Diſpenſation of the outward Senſes. It keeps an account alſo of all things that have been tranſacted, and is always ready to produce out of its Store-houſe whatſoever the Superiour Faculties ſhall require. The Seat and Region of <hi>Memory</hi> is in the <hi>Brain,</hi> but where it makes its reſidence I leave to Anatomiſts to determine. Some are of Opinion that it is ſeated in that <hi>Meditullium</hi> or void ſpace in the middle and Centre of the <hi>Brain,</hi> where as in a capacious Cave or Receptacle, it lies remote from Noiſe. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hold that the Images of all ſenſible
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100787:55"/>
Objects, are laid up in the Concavities of the <hi>Brain,</hi> and that thoſe delicate and numberleſs Partitions, which we ſee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed over all the whole Maſs with ſuch aſtoniſhment and wonder, are as ſo many Cells in which the Images of things are diſtinctly conſerv'd, according to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Species: which latter Opinion ſeems to be more probable, becauſe we ſee that thoſe who have the greateſt Heads, have generally the beſt Memories; beſides, many Perſons have receiv'd great Decays in their Memories, and others have loſt them utterly by reaſon of ſome great blows or wounds in the Head, which could not be poſſible did the ſeat of Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reach ſo far as to that vacant place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpoken of, which lies too remote to receive injury by ſuch Accidents: For ſhould the hurt extend ſo far, 'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but it ſhould be attended with preſent death. It is ſomewhat ſtrange what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Sixth, that whereas he was a perſon of a bad Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by Nature, by receiving accidentally a great blow upon his Head, his Memory became very good ever after; which ſhews that by the violence of the Percuſſion, his <hi>Brains</hi> were ſtruck out of their former Station into a more convenient Situation, and ſuch as ſerv'd for the better retention
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100787:55"/>
of the ſenſory Images. As for that void Concavity which lies in the middle of the <hi>Brain,</hi> it ſeems to be deſtin'd for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Nobleſt and moſt ſublime Faculty of the Soul, the Underſtanding: for what other Function it ſhould ſerve for, the moſt curious Anatomiſts could never yet diſcover, there being nothing to be found in it after all their Obſervations but a little thin and watry ſubſtance. Beſides, it being in the Center and moſt remote from from all External violence and diſturbance, and being always in one even temper, it muſt be allow'd to be the moſt Natural and proper place for Cogitation, and that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dateneſs with which Reaſon ought to act, ſo that 'tis like the Head of an Alembeck always cool, and ſerves to unite the Spirits, which are the immediate Inſtruments of Senſe and Motion.</p>
               <p>There are two ſorts of <hi>Memory,</hi> of which one conſiſts purely in Rehearſal. This ſort of <hi>Memory</hi> is uſeful to Preachers, Orators, and ſuch as are oblig'd to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themſelves in ſet Forms, and in this kind ſome men are very happy. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> that he was able to recite any thing upon the firſt hearing of it, and of this he gave an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance before the King of <hi>France.</hi> A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Poet had in a ſolemn Audience ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangu'd
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100787:56"/>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth by the Rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of a long ſtrain of Verſes, which the King and all the Court much commended: The Cardinal told them that the Verſes were ſtoln, and to make this good he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited them <hi>verbatim</hi> in the ſame order as they had been before delivered. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Poet began to change Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and had faln into perpetual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, had not the Cardinal declar'd that what he did was only a Trick, to ſhew the ſtrength and force of his own Memory. Others there are who will run over a Muſter-roll of hard Names which they never heard of before in the ſame order as they are recited by another. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing Faculty though it may beget ſome little Admiration in the Hearers is really of little benefit, for what is learn'd this way is as eaſily forgotten. There is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of <hi>Memory</hi> which conſiſts in a firm and a ſteady Retention of what we have either ſeen, heard, or read of, and ſuch as is always ready to furniſh us with matter upon any Exigence: This muſt be acknowledg'd to be of great uſe, both at the Council Table and at the Bar: For ſuch Perſons are oblig'd ever and anon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o hunt after Preſidents, and to ranſack An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Records: It concerns them therefore to know the Tranſactions of former Ages as
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100787:56"/>
well as of the preſent, and to have Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples always in ſtore. They are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to ſtate the Caſes of Perſons with all their circumſtances, and to make reply to all things which may be urg'd to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. This kind of <hi>Memory</hi> alſo is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully ſerviceable in Converſation, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially amongſt thoſe who take delight in telling News, or in rehearſing of ſome Tale for divertiſement: It is then only of bad uſe, when it is employ'd in the recital of paſt injuries, and in relating paſſages which tend to the ſhame and diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe who have no way offended us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Memory</hi> though it may be uſeful to judgement by propoſing Examples and Conſequences, which have hapned for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly upon like Circumſtances, with theſe under which we lie at preſent, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it happens often that the variety of Inſtances <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> with which a great Memory is always furniſh'd, does but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard the Judgement, and make it more wavering and irreſolute<hi>:</hi> Beſides, Perſons who have great <hi>Memories,</hi> do love to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play their Gifts, ſo that generally they are great Talkers, a quality not very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, and ſuch as is no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Judgment which weighs its Counſels with Maturity and Silence.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>Of the Imagination.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AFter the Conſideration of <hi>Memory</hi> follows that of <hi>Imagination</hi> as being a Superiour Faculty, for ſo it is that the <hi>Memory</hi> out of its own Store-houſe of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, does furniſh the <hi>Imagination</hi> with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials to work upon. <hi>Imagination</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is a Power of the Soul, chooſing at pleaſure ſuch Images as <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Memory,</hi> has drawn upon the <hi>Mind,</hi> and uniting them together in ſuch a form as ſeems to repreſent ſome new Compound, not yet exiſting in Nature. It is an imitation therefore of that Omnipotence in the great Creatour of the World, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd all things from thoſe Idea's which he firſt form'd within himſelf. The pleaſant deſcriptions of Poetry, the Pomp and Ornaments of the Theatre, the Curioſities and Magnificence of Buildings are all but the Productions of the <hi>Imagination;</hi> all charming Notes of Muſick, the rare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100787:57"/>
of Painting and Sculpture, together with all the ingenious Inventions of Artiſts, are deriv'd from hence. To this we owe all thoſe Modes and Faſhions of Apparrel with which we are ſo much delighted: To this we owe all the Pleaſures of the Palat, all the Recreations and Divertiſements of Life, and in a word, whatſoever tends to the advancement of Arts, and to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of Nature; when the Imagination therefore doth form an <hi>Idea</hi> of a thing, the Will preſently apprehends it, either as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable and Good, or as Evil and Diſtaſtful: Hereupon the Underſtanding goes imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to work, and by Rules of Reaſon judges of the Convenience, or Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of what's propos'd. This then ſeems to be the Method of the Souls Acting. Firſt Senſe and Memory preſent us with the ſimple Images of Things, the Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on makes the Compoſition, the Will De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires or Diſlikes; and laſtly, the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding doth make its Judgment of it.</p>
               <p>Some Nations are naturally addicted to ſome particular Fancies above others. The <hi>French</hi> being generally of a gay and jovial Humour, their Imaginations lead them to be Amorous; and in purſuance hereof they have a particular Genius for Romances, and Hiſtories of Gallantry, as alſo for Loveing ſports, Balls, variety of Modes, forms of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:100787:58"/>
Complement, with ſuch like Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as ſeem to cheriſh that wanton Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The <hi>Italians</hi> who are of a Temper a little more Saturnine and ſerious, have their Imaginations generally carried away with the Love of Muſick, Painting and Sculpture, all which require a pregnant Fancy to Invent, and much time to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect what they do deſign. Men who are of retir'd and ſerious Inclinations, are leſs volatile and luxuriant in their Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but withal they are moſt reſolute in the proſecution of whatſoever they are addicted to: They will never deſiſt till they have brought their matters to matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and generally all great Deſigns owe their Birth and Perfection to Men of this Temper. The <hi>Dutch</hi> naturally are a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy ſlugiſh People, ſymbolizing with the Air, or Water rather in which they Breath: Hence it is, that they are flow at Projection, but what they do once at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, eſpecially in matters which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern their Intereſt, they are moſt obſtinate to bring it to Perfection. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the <hi>French</hi> living in a pure and ſubtile Air, abound with more Spirits, but then they are unapt to proſecute any thing which implys Difficulty and Patience. Their great abundance of Heat ſtill ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting to them Varieties of new Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:100787:58"/>
they preſently quit their firſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns upon the apprehenſion of Difficulty, which in Concluſion renders them very Unconſtant and Wavering. The <hi>Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings,</hi> as they are betwixt them in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Situation, ſo do they partake with them too in their Genius and Inclinations, being both good at deſign, and happy in the Improvement of all ſorts of Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures.</p>
               <p>There is another ſort of Imagination which conſiſts meerly in Apprehenſion, and is found to have a wonderful Influence upon the Perſon that is the Subject of it. We may obſerve ſome Perſons that they daily fall ſick and die by the force meerly of Imagination. I knew a Family in which there were many Brothers, all hopeful Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, of which, one dying of the ſmall Pox, all the reſt, being four or five in Number, excepting one only, fell ſick of the ſame Diſtemper in ſome ſhort ſpace after, and dyed, tho they were at diſtance from one another, and out of all reach of Contagion. In order to Health, Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is of great Force and Virtue: When a Man hath a good Opinion of his Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, and of what he gives him, his Heart ſeems to dilate it ſelf with a kind of Joy: This gives an eaſy Circulation to the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and makes them more capable to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:100787:59"/>
entertain the Medicine. Beſides, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits which before were drooping, upon the apprehenſion of Safety ſummon up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and Nature doth its utmoſt efforts to help on the Delivery. The Spirits are the Vehicles of Life, and move ſlower or faſter, according as the Imagination is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt upon which they do depend. Women great with Child are very ſubject to ſtrange effects of Imagination. It is ſaid that the Antipathy which King <hi>James</hi> had to a naked Sword, proceeded from the Fright which the Queen his Mother took when ſhe was big with him, at ſuch time as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Rizius</hi> was purſu'd by Aſſaſſinates with naked Swords, and villanouſly Murdered in her Preſence. It is ſtrange what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus,</hi> who being baniſh'd by the Emperor <hi>Domitian,</hi> that Diſgrace made ſuch an Impreſſion on him, that the Tyrant ſeem'd preſent always to his Imagination. In the midſt of an Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue which he made to the People of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus,</hi> he began to deliver himſelf more ſoft and ſlowly than ordinary; at length, making a Pauſe, he abruptly quitted the Subject he was upon, and retreating three or four paces, he look'd on the Ground with an intent and menacing Countenance, and uttered theſe Words; <hi>Smite, ſmite the Tyrant,</hi> which he ſpoke with that Force
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:100787:59"/>
and Agony, as ſeeming to be preſent and aſſiſting at the Act: At which the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence being amaz'd, <hi>Apollonius</hi> like one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd out of a Trance, cry'd out, Courage my Friends, the Tyrant is ſlain this Day, nay rather, this very inſtant, ſo help me <hi>Pallas,</hi> which as <hi>Philostratus</hi> (the writer of his Life) reports, prov'd to be the ſame day and hour that the Emperor was Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. Many Inſtances of this nature oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur of the Force of Imagination in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tranſactions done at diſtance; I ſhall not here pretend to give a natural Reaſon for ſuch Prodigies, nevertheleſs this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that Imagination has not only had a great Aſcendent over the Spirits and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of particular Men, but even of Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and Armies. <hi>Alexander</hi> finding his Souldiers diſmay'd at the difficulty of paſſing the River <hi>Granic,</hi> conſults with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtander</hi> the South-ſayer, how he might keep up the fainting Spirits of his Army<hi>: Ariſtander</hi> being then about to ſacrifice, with a certain Juyce ſecretly writes in the Palm of his Hand theſe Words, with the Letters Invers'd <hi>[the Gods have granted that</hi> Alexander <hi>ſhall be Victorious]</hi> which he had no ſooner done, but taking the Victims Liver into his Hand, the foreſaid Inſcription was ſo attracted by the Blood and Heat of the Beaſt's Liver, that the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100787:60"/>
appear'd in their natural Order and Figure inſcrib'd upon the Entrails, which ſhewing to thoſe who were about him, they all cry'd out a Miracle, in which Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the Souldiers took Courage, and paſſing the River became Victorious.</p>
               <p>Melancholy Perſons are ſubject to ſtrong Imaginations. Some have fancied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be Ghoſts, Birds, Wolves, with a thouſand ſuch Extravagancies, and to ſpeak the Truth, the whole World is upon the matter govern'd by this Idol. He who is actually a King, and the Madman who fancies himſelf a King, have both of them, upon the matter, the ſame Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. One tho he really taſts the Fruits of Grandure, yet if we examine the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoroughly, all his Enjoyments do ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in Fancy: And if his Palat be more acute to reliſh the Pleaſure, ſo is it more ſenſible of the Bitterneſs and Anxiety which doth accompany that State; whereas the other by fancying himſelf Happy, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſo, ſince he feels no want. Hunger nor Cold never afflict him, he complains not of Treachery and ungrateful Miniſters; he meets with no potent Factions at home, nor Confederacies abroad, to diſturb his imaginary Government: He fancies that he Rules without Controul, he makes Laws, he creates him Noble-Men, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:100787:60"/>
Officers at his Will and Pleaſure, and in the ſtrength of his Perſwaſion he paſſes away his Life merrily, Singing and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding his own Felicity and Power; thus fares it with the happy Lunatick, whilſt many others who would be thought to be in their right Wits and Senſes, are really Mad, thoſe I mean, who upon every lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Croſs or Capricio fall into a raving Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>

               <p>AS Imagination follows the reports of Senſe, ſo the Will with its Paſſions follows the Bent of the Imagination. The Will therefore is nothing but a Power of Election or Reprobation of things either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable or diſpleaſing. The Paſſions by which it acts are chiefly theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Love and Hatred, Deſire and Averſion, Joy and Sorrow, Anger and Complacency, Hope and Fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As to the Seat of the Will,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:100787:61"/>
as alſo of the Paſſions 'tis without diſpute in the Heart. This appears moſt evidently from Bluſhes and Paleneſs, from that quick Circulation and boyling of the Blood, and from thoſe beatings and that deficiency which at other times affect that Noble part, with ſuch alterations as immediately ſeize the Blood. Upon occaſions of Sorrow, Fear, or Diſpair, we feel an Oppreſſion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the Heart; upon the report of Good News we feel a certain dilatation of the Spirits, all is open, and thoſe Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Life run ſmooth and calmly in their ſeveral Channels. The Paſſions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are as it were the reſorts and Springs of Life, without which all things would move dead and heavily.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Stoicks</hi> 'tis true, were Men of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther belief: they rejected the Paſſions as uſeleſs, they taught that a Man ought not to be ſorrowful for the Calamities of his Friend, nor rejoyce at his Welfare, upon this perſwaſion, that a Wiſeman enjoy'd all things within himſelf, and was therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of being made better by Fortune or worſe by Injury. From whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd that whoſoever did Defame, Rob, wound a Man, did him no Injury; and if ſo, then 'twould follow likewiſe that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhould commit ſuch an Outrage, would commit no crime; as alſo, that all ſorts
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100787:61"/>
of Violence offered to another, whether Slander, Theft or Murder, would be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually indifferent and inoffenſive, for where there is no Injury done, there can be no degrees of offence. Thus theſe Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers whilſt they endeavour'd to raiſe a man above the Stars and Clouds into the Sphere of the <hi>Moon,</hi> did really degrade him into the Region of Beaſts, or rather of Stocks and Stones, when they deſcrib'd him as a Creature ſtupid and ſenſeleſs, without Heat and Motion. But whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thoſe airy Notions were with which they endeavour'd to delude their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, 'tis certain that when they came to put their Doctrine into practice, they ſoon chang'd the Natural Philoſopher into the Natural man; for beſides their Pride and Covetouſneſs for which they were ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, we find them alſo to have been Moroſe and Cynical, violent in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives, and ſubject to all the tranſports of Choler and Intemperance. The Rules of their Profeſſion were for the moſt part meaſur'd by a Cloak and a long Beard, of which the loſs in the Fictions of <hi>Lucian,</hi> was a thing of ſuch importance as was capable to draw Tears from the greateſt of them.</p>
               <p>But to leave theſe Philoſophers and their Beards, we have Arguments of better
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100787:62"/>
Authority to prove that Paſſions are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and conſiſtent with human Nature in its higheſt Perfection, witneſs our Bleſſed Saviour who was ſeen to Weep, to be Angry, to be Compaſſionate, and tender, with ſuch like alterations as argu'd a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation of Spirit. Nay God Almighty in the Divinity, though he be free from all alterations and diſturbance of Paſſion, is pleas'd nevertheleſs to appear to Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſeveral ſhapes of Love, Pity, Anger, Jealouſy, Hatred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the end he might Create in us the like Paſſions for Good and Evil. How is it poſſible to perſwade a Man to embrace Virtue, but by repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it Cloath'd with all thoſe Beauties which may create a Love, and then a deſire of it? How is it poſſible to diſſwade a Man from Vice, as Drunkenneſs, for inſtance, but by repreſenting it as injurious to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and Eſtate, as deſtructive of Health and Natural Parts, as loathſome and painful to the Body, and as puniſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with Eternal Miſery hereafter? all which cannot chooſe but create in us a fear of the Puniſhment, as well as a hatred of the Guilt. The Paſſions are like Winds, when they are regular and moderate they fill the Sail, and carry on the Ship to the deſired Port, but when they are interrupted and violent, they
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:100787:62"/>
ſerve only to raiſe a Tempeſt, and menace nothing but danger and ruine. 'Tis the buſineſs therefore of reaſon to give them their meaſures, and this it does theſe two ways, firſt by fixing them on the right Objects, and this is done when we love that which is truly virtuous, brave and honeſt, and when we hate that which is really loathſome, unjuſt and ſhameful, <hi>&amp;c. Secondly,</hi> By aſſigning them their proper degrees, and not ſuffering them to run out into Extremity, we may be Angry, but not be tranſported with Fury; we may deſire but not with impatience: All Tranſports of this kind argue weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Judgment; they are injurious to our ſelves as well as to others, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the due accompliſhment of what we do deſign. Is a Man prone to Love, let him fix his Love upon ſuch an Object as is moſt Beautiful, moſt durable, and moſt beneficial to him, I mean the great Creatour, from whom he receives Life with all its Comforts; and with reſpect to him, let him love Man his Image, and ſuch eſpecially as merit our Gratitude: if a Man be prone to Anger, let him cheriſh his Paſſion againſt the Enemies of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Virtue, and againſt Atheiſm, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, Fraud, Hypocriſie, Perjury, Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſuch like Vices as are every where popular and inſulting.</p>

The Paſſions of unconſtant Perſons, as is excellently well deſcrib'd by <hi>Cauſin,</hi> are for the moſt part eager and ardent at the beginning, but are of little duration, for ſuch men are preſently tir'd with what is preſent, and always look after things to come, being never where they are, and being always where they are not, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can be; they are every day at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their life, even then when they ſhould be at an end, and the good Actions which they do, they do them not but by halves, being never at leiſure to finiſh their works by reaſon of their precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the diverſity of deſires which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, drawing them ſometimes here and ſometimes there, and ruining all the deſigns and level of their Spirit. One may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in them a great thirſt after Novelty, and continual changes of Manners, Study, Habit, and Courſe of life, as alſo of Speech, Converſe, Sports, Exerciſe, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, Amours and Friendſhip, with mouths breathing both hot and cold at once. In ſhort, their life is nothing but a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al flux and reflux, being repleniſh'd with ſhadows, giddineſs and illuſions which, in effect makes them moſt miſerable, and is uſually attended with diſeſteem, grief and tediouſneſs of life, and with great Naufrage of Spirit and Reputation: Thus he: Indeed a
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100787:63"/>
Paſſionate man does at the ſame time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and languiſh, he hopes and yet faſtens on nothing: He rejoyces and repents, and oftentimes contemns the Poſſeſſion of a thing which he a thouſand times deſir'd. His Pretenſions are Contradictious: He Conjures by Heaven, and deteſts the Earth; He Curſes men and all living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and is a burden to himſelf, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible to all the World.</p>
               <p>This Conſideration then of the great Variety of the Paſſions, and of the great Contrariety to one another, makes me willing to ſubſcribe to their Opinion, who hold that Man at preſent is a more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Creature than he was in the State of Innocence: for then he had all the means of ſafety in his own power; his Underſtanding was pregnant and clear, his Will was moſt free and unbyaſs'd, and all his Paſſions were in a quiet and dutiful O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience thereunto; ſo that there was little Prudence to be then ſhewn in his Actions, which were ſo well fenc'd, and as it were hedg'd in on all ſides from Danger and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror: Whereas now all his Faculties being obſcur'd and in perpetual diſorder, and he having very fallacious and imperfect means to inform himſelf in his Courſes, and being ſurrounded alſo with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Temptations and Difficulties, it ſhews
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100787:64"/>
a generous Courage in him to attempt, and as great Conduct in him to perſevere in the ways of Virtue. 'Tis no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a man to be Victorious, who is encompaſs'd with a Puiſſant, Vigilant and well diſciplin'd Army; but he who can overcome whilſt his Souldiers are in Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and whilſt he lies Entrenched amongſt the Snares and Stratagems of his Enemy, he indeed deſerves the Name of a brave Commander. As that Conſtitution of Body is beſt which can endure all Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Extremities, ſo likewiſe that health of Mind, is moſt to be accounted of, which can overcome the greateſt Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Diſorders. They therefore who can curb themſelves when they are running upon a Precipice, and (in my Lord <hi>Verulam</hi>'s phraſe) give the Mind (as we ſee in Horſemanſhip) the ſhorteſt ſtop or turn, are really Men of true Abilities and Art: What that great and Learned man hath in his Excellent judgement taken notice of, is moſt worthy a ſerious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> that this Combate of the Paſſions with one another is of ſpecial uſe in Moral and Civil matters: For by this we are taught how to ſet Affection againſt Affection, and to maſter one by another, even as we uſe to hunt Beaſt with Beaſt, which we could not otherwiſe ſo eaſily
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:100787:64"/>
compaſs. Upon this Foundation is erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Excellent uſe of <hi>Proemium</hi> and <hi>Poena</hi> by which Civil States conſiſt; imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Predominant affections of fear and hope, for the ſuppreſſing and bridling of the reſt: For as in the Government of States it is ſometimes neceſſary to bridle one Faction with another, ſo is it in the Government within. Thus far he.</p>
               <p>Men who are not ſubject to the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of Paſſion, whether of Love, Anger, Fear, Sorrow, <hi>&amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> have great advantages above others in many reſpects. And firſt in matters of Deliberation and Counſel. A man of this Temper can calmly and patiently hear all that is alledg'd <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> without being ſhaken: Anothers Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on does not move him, he lays hold of his Extravagancies and delivers his own Senſe without heſitation and ſtammering, and without giving any ground of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to him, with whom he is in debate: His hand holds the Ballance without trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and he takes ſteady meaſures of the Mark; all which 'tis impoſſible for one to do, who ſuffers his Reaſon to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd by the unſeaſonable and immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Exerciſes of ſome rebellious Paſſion. Stateſmen above all others ought to ſtudy this Art, as having the Eyes of many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Enemies always on them, and where
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100787:65"/>
a ſmall Extravagance of words may be the ruine both of their Counſels and of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. In the next place, in matters pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Converſation, the even temper'd Man has much the advantage: He is agreeable and inoffenſive in all Companies, he rarely provokes others to Anger, and if he meets with any thing which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking, he either ſlights it, or puts the beſt diſguiſe and ſenſe upon it that the matter will bear. He chaſtiſes the frown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Countenance of another with a ſmile, and turns that which was deſign'd as an Affront into Mirth and Drollery. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all it is obſervable in Men of this Temper, that they are bad for Execution, and that they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are generally Hypocrites. They are the worſt, of Friends in as much as they are never toucht Paſſionately with their Friends Concerns, and they are the worſt of Enemies too, as never giving no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the miſchief they intend: Such a one was <hi>Tiberius</hi> of old, and ſuch alſo were <hi>Andronicus, Comnenus,</hi> and King <hi>Richard</hi> the Third of <hi>England,</hi> all which were great Diſſemblers, and purſu'd moſt Bloody and Malicious deſigns under the appearance of Mildneſs and Affability.</p>
               <p>Contrary Paſſions are found generally in the ſame ſubject and to the ſame degree. He who is prone to Love a thing exceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100787:65"/>
will with the ſame Exceſs hate any thing that does oppoſe him, he who is immoderate in his Joy, will be as immoderate alſo in his Sorrow upon the privation of that which gave him matter of delight.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not here confine my ſelf to the Method of the Schools, who reduce the Paſſions to Iraſeible and Concupiſcible: I ſhall rather range them under theſe two general heads of Love and Hatred, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the two grand Motives of the Will, which are the Univerſal and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive ſcope of all our Actions Good and Evil: for to theſe two all the other Paſſions are reduc'd. Firſt for Love, if the good be only in proſpect it is call'd Deſire, but if the attainment of it be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with uncertainty it is called Hope; if it be in our actual poſſeſſion, it procures Complacency and Delight; if there be danger of anothers getting it from us, it begets Jealouſie; And laſtly, if it be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to us, and if we have a certainty of obtaining it, the conſideration of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets Joy. Therefore Hatred, if the Evil be future, and only in proſpect it is called Diſlike or Slight, if there be a probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that it will happen to us, it is called Fear: If it actually happen to us, and there be an inclination to oppoſe it, it begets Anger: If it conſiſt in the want of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100787:66"/>
which we cannot obtain, and which is in the poſſeſſion of another, it begets Envy; And laſtly, if it be ſuch as we believe cannot be remedied, or ſuch as we believe cannot be prevented, it begets Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Theſe are principal Affections and Diſpoſitions of the Mind, to which all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are reduc'd. Now when I ſpeak of Good and Evil, as the grand Motives of our Affections, and the ultimate end of all our Actions, I do not intend really what is Good or Evil, but what we apprehend to be ſo: For many times we purſue a real Evil under the form and appearance of ſomething Good, and we decline a real good upon the apprehenſion we have of its being Evil: Good and Evil therefore are not here to be underſtood Morally and in themſelves, but with reſpect to the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of him who wills.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIV. <hi>Of Love and Hatred, of Jealouſie and Envy, of Deſire and Diſlike.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Begin with Love which is the Nobleſt Paſſion of the Soul, and a Ray of the Divine Nature. God when he made the World pronounc'd of all things in it, that they were exceeding Good: Now goodneſs being the Meaſure and Object of Love, it follows that whatſoever God made became the Object of his Love; the more there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we love, the more reſemblance we have to that Divine Goodneſs. However Love as it is attributed to God, differs very much from that which is in Men: Firſt then they differ in reſpect of their Nature; in Man it is Paſſion attended with Deſire, Hope, Fear, Sorrow, and ſuch like altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as are accompanied with great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, and imply imperfection in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who is the ſubject of them: But in God it is one perpetual Emanation of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs derivable on others without diſorder
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:100787:67"/>
or dimunition of ſtore: In the next place they differ in reſpect of their ſeveral ends: Mans Love always terminates in himſelf; if we love Creatures of the ſame Nature with our ſelves, we do it that they may love us again, or if we transfer our Love to things inferiour to our Nature, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Animate or Inanimate, we do it upon this account, that they may be ſome way beneficial to us, either in reſpect of Pleaſure or Service. But if we place our Love upon the ſupream Object from whom we derive our beings, we do it either that he may continue his Bleſſings to us, or upon the hopes we have of receiving new Meaſures of his Bounty. 'Tis true, Schoolmen may talk of a Divine Love, and ſo forth, but when we come to Examine our Affections to the bottom, we find ſelf-intereſt to be the Centre of our Deſires; and thoſe who pretend to love Virtue for Virtues ſake, will at length be forct to acknowledg that they do ſo upon the account of that Reputation which accompanies, or of that Reward which follows the practice of it: from whence it follows that our own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and felicity has a great ſhare in the Duty, whereas the Love of God is carried directly upon the Object without any deſire or poſſibility of receiving bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit from it: Like the <hi>Sun,</hi> it is continually
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:100787:67"/>
ſtreaming forth its benign Influence upon the Earth, without ever receiving any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit or recompence.</p>
               <p>Some mens Love is more particular and ardent, exerting as it were all the Force and Powers of the Soul, for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of ſome one Object, with which it afterwards ſeems incorporated by ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Unions of Complacency and Delight: This is many times Conſpicuous in thoſe more Sacred Ties of Matrimony and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Others there are who love with a more remiſs and general Affection, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributing that ſtock on many which they refuſe to appropriate to one; hence it is that thoſe who profeſs Celibacy are generally better natur'd than others, whoſe Love is engroſs'd by one: Alſo Religious men who are cut off from particular Endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſeem to have a more general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and Tenderneſs for Mankind.</p>
               <p>Love, as <hi>Cauſin</hi> obſerves, from the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of its Objects has ſeveral Names, if it move directly towards God, and reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly on our Neighbour as his Image, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one for himſelf and the other for his Author, it is called Charity; if it diffuſe it ſelf on divers Creatures, ſenſible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible, being ſuch which ſerve for Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or Commodity, ſuch as Horſes, Jewels, Birds, Pictures, Books, Medals,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100787:68"/>
Flowers or the like, it is nothing but Appetite or ſimple Affection; if it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes it ſelf to humane Creatures, by way of reciprocal Benevolence, it is called Friendſhip; if it level at bodily Pleaſure, it is a love of Concupiſcence, which being immoderate even with intention of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage does not ceaſe to be Vicious: If it be regulated by Bounds preſcrib'd by the Law of God, it is called Conjugal Love, if it overflows into ſenſual Pleaſures, it is called Luxury.</p>
               <p>There are twelve Marks given by <hi>Jo. Picus Mirandula,</hi> by which we may judge of a true and real Love: The firſt is to Love one and one only, and to Contemn all other things in Compariſon of him. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To think himſelf unhappy when he is not with the Perſon he loves. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To be willing to ſuffer all things, even Death it ſelf that he may ſerve him. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To adjuſt himſelf in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as may render his perſon acceptable to the Party he loves. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> To be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with him ſo far forth as he is able, if not totally at leaſt in thought and deſire. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> To love his Friends, Kindred, Houſe, Cloaths, Pictures, or whatſoever elſe does any way relate to him. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> To deſire his Praiſe and Reputation, and to be impatient at his diſgrace; to rejoyce
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:100787:68"/>
at his good Fortune, and to grieve at his loſſes. <hi>Eightly,</hi> To believe him Maſter of the greateſt Perfections, and endeavour to draw others to the ſame belief. <hi>Ninth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> To be always in a readineſs to ſuffer for his ſake, and to think ſuch ſufferings ſweet. <hi>Tenthly,</hi> To weep often upon his account, through Grief if abſent, through Joy if preſent. <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> To languiſh always and expire in deſire after him. And Laſtly, to ſerve him readily and cheerfully without hopes of Reward.</p>
               <p>Love if it be not reciprocal, is commonly requited with ſecret Contempt and Scorn: whoſoever therefore feels this Paſſion growing on him, if he finds he cannot get ground, let him retreat betimes, for although Importunity may tire out a Perſon to make a condeſcenſion, yet there being a kind of force which goes along with it, Nature will quickly ſpring back to its former bent as ſoon as the force does ceaſe: and upon this account we ſee, that the firſt Interviews of Perſons do uſually make the deepeſt and the moſt permanent Impreſſions.</p>
               <p>Martiall men have been always ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to <hi>Venus:</hi> and as the <hi>Romans</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd their Original from her Son <hi>Aeneas</hi> and from the <hi>Trojans</hi> his Companions, So the greateſt Hero amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:100787:69"/>
even <hi>Caeſar,</hi> own'd <hi>Venus</hi> for his Tutelar Deity, invoking her in Fight, and making her the Symbol and Watch-word of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: It was to <hi>Venus</hi> he aſcribed the Victory over <hi>Pompey</hi> in the Plains of <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> where he built a Temple to her: in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> War he March'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her Colours againſt <hi>Pompey</hi> the Son: his Devices had all of them alluſion to her, he bore her Figure upon his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and all his Letters and Diſpatches were Sign'd with her Image. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had this Honour for her as ſhe was the Goddeſs of Love, is not ſo certain; 'Tis more probable he did it for the glory of the <hi>Julian</hi> Family, which deſcended from <hi>Julius Aſcanius</hi> her Grandſon, ſo that his Medals might have born the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of <hi>Veneri Genetrici,</hi> but he choſe that rather of <hi>Veneri Victrici,</hi> or <hi>Venus</hi> the Victorious: for ſo ſhe was more properly over him, being ſubdu'd by the Beauty and Eloquence of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> but not ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely as was <hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi> who prefer'd the Beauty and Dalliance of that Mignonne before Honour and Empire. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo his Competitor who Govern'd the World in great Felicity, and the longeſt of any Emperour, was himſelf a ſlave to the Paſſions of <hi>Livia;</hi> ſo that as Women
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:100787:69"/>
for the moſt part <hi>(Hippia-like)</hi> affect Sword-men; ſo theſe make it ſome part of their Glory to extend their Conqueſt over the other Sex, tho 'tis ſeldome that they are infatuated with Love in ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as thoſe are who live an idle and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous Life. The former make it but a Divertiſement, and for the Recreation of their Spirits; the latter an Employment: The one taſts of it only as Sawce; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feeds upon it as a ſtanding Diſh.</p>
               <p>Love is much indebted to Romances and Poets for its Beauty, and yet the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter repreſent it many times in a very unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Figure: They make <hi>Cupid</hi> blind, thereby ſhewing the Errors and Dangers they are expoſed to who follow its Guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and when they deſcribe <hi>Hercules</hi> ſpinning at <hi>Omphale</hi>'s Diſtaff, and ſhe laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at him, they do not only tell us that it is able to enervate the greateſt Virtue, but that it makes the braveſt Men ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and expoſes them to the Scorn and Deriſion of the weakeſt: For indeed what can be more ridiculous than to ſee a Man, otherwiſe of Senſe and Underſtanding, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to the miſerable Condition of ſeeking all his Felicity from a Miſtriſs? How doth this Knight errant hug himſelf in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of his imaginary Purchaſe? How doth he ſwell in his Feathers, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:100787:70"/>
fancy himſelf to be the moſt accompliſh'd Cavalier breathing? He dreams of his fair Lady by Night, and meets with her in his moſt watchful Thoughts; he haunts her Walks, and bribes thoſe who are about her, to be inſtrumental in his Pretenſions: He thinks every Hour a Year till he gets into her Lodging, where with invincible Patience he expects her Sight, thinking ſhe is very tedious in her coming, and yet dreads the Onſet, and fainting under Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitations of Heart, he begins to wiſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf off again: At laſt he doth approach her with much Humility and ſtudied Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, which he utters not without ſome Trembling and Confuſion: He waits upon her Eyes, he lays hold of every Glance, and ſhapes himſelf to all her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Diſcourſe: He careſſes her with Amours and wanton Sonnets, with flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Poems, and with Stories of Intrigue and Gallantry. He ſwears ſhe is divinely Fair, that ſhe is the moſt charming Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Breathing, and will be ready to fight another who is not of the ſame Belief. One while he aſſaults her with a brisk Gayety, at another time by Feigning a Retreat he hopes to draw her after him, and to take her by Surprize. But if theſe Arts fail, he attempts to melt her into Compaſſion by Sighing, Languiſhing, or by writing paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100787:70"/>
and dying Letters. He fancies her to be all Angelical; a knot of Ribbond, a lock of Hair, or any ſuch like Excrement, is a thing of ineſtimable Value, and has a Virtue more than Magnetick. In ſhort, by theſe and a thouſand other ſuch Love Stories, he hopes to win her Favour, and when he thinks he is upon the point of taking Poſſeſſion, all is blaſted by one coy Look; and a Frown is able to calcine him into Duſt. Then with Tears, and with a vile and humble Submiſſion he lies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate at her Feet, and will dye unleſs ſhe lend him a Smile, which is ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call him to Life again, and then he acts o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all his former Follies. But all this is nothing to the Miſeries which a paſſionate Lover ſuffers in his Mind: One while he is intoxicated with Hope, by and by he is caſt down with Fear: This Hour he is in a burning Fit, and nothing but Feaver; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non all his Blood is congeal'd to Ice, and a Trembling ſeizes upon every Nerve<hi>:</hi> His Voice fails him, his Countenance grows pale, and he ſuffers under palpitation of Heart, and deſertion of Spirit. One while he ſtorms and rages at his Diſappointments, a little after he repents, and puts on Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of enduring all things with a Stoical Courage, ſwallowing all Affronts, digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Delays, and flattering moſt when
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:100787:71"/>
his Heart is ready to burſt with inward Anguiſh and Diſdain. Thus he ſpends his Life betwixt Fancies of Fruition and real Diſappointments; he courts the imaginary Graces, and is torn in pieces by real Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; but above all, the Thoughts of a Rival fill him with a thouſand Torments; and here it is that the Conqueſt ſhews her greateſt Art and Cruelty in putting her Lover upon the Rack: He is tortur'd at the pleaſure of his Miſtreſs, who takes delight to kill him and to revive him, tho it be but to ſhew her own Power and Omnipotence, till at length the poor Man grows ſottiſh, Melancholy, and Diſtracted, he Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with Solitude and Shades; or if he comes into Company, his Speech is broken and incoherent, talking ever and anon of his dearly Beloved, at a moſt extravagant and fulſome rate; and by this means renders himſelf not only Contemptible in the ſight of his Miſtriſs, but of his Acquaintance al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and of all Mankind beſides, to the great Reproach of his Reputation, and to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ruine of his Health and Fortune. And thus do many Men betray themſelves to perpetual Miſeries, in Courting that God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs, which when obtain'd proves but a Cloud within the Arms, and ſuch a one as is many times made up of nothing but Storms and Thunder.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:100787:71"/>
Jealouſy is the Canker of Love, like a Canker 'tis bred by too much Fertility of the Soyl; it ſprings from an exuberant Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and creeping on by little and little, it never ceaſes Fretting and gnawing upon the Body, till it withers &amp; dyes. Every Man therefore who embarques after Love, ought well to examine the Temper of his own Nature, eſpecially if he be concern'd with a celebrated Beauty, for ſuch a one will attract the Eyes and Careſſes of all Men, nor is it in the Power of a Woman to hear herſelf cajol'd, and not return ſome reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proque Smiles, and obliging Regards on him who pays her Honour. The <hi>Diamond,</hi> tho it be the moſt Beautiful and the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of Jewels, will be deſſolv'd, they ſay, by the warm Blood of a Goat. A laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Speech or Touch may make the moſt adamantine Nature relent and yield. Where Service and Reſpect are tender'd, a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may make a ſuitable return of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment without blemiſh to her Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: And yet in him who loves paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this is able to beget Suſpition, which always views things at the worſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: For as Courtſhip and an inſinuating Addreſs cannot but incline Nature to be favourable, ſo the more ſubtile and refin'd Gallant doth attaque always in Maſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade, and under the diſguiſe of Urbanity
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:100787:72"/>
and of a readineſs to oblige. Strange was the Jealouſy which I have ſomewhere read in <hi>Guicciarden,</hi> of an <hi>Italian</hi> Gentleman who married a very beautiful Woman, and ſuch a one as he himſelf believed to be moſt Chaſt. One Night after he had embrac'd her with all tenderneſs of Love imaginable, he told her that one thing troubled the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and quiet of his Life; for tho he had no reaſon to diſtruſt her Virtue, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t yet being ſo extremely Beautiful and Eloquent as ſhe was, he believed ſhe would be ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited, and be perſwaded by anothers Love, in caſe he dy'd before her; nor could he endure to think that any other Perſon ſhould ever enjoy ſo fair a Creature. To prevent all which, he told her that he had provided an Expedient, and forthwith drawing out a Dagger which lay conceal'd behind the Pillow, as he embrac'd her with one Arm, he ſtab'd her with the other, and then ſtab'd himſelf upon her Body. The wretched Husband died immediately, but the unfortunate Lady lived ſome hours to make a report of this ſad Tragedy, and then died alſo.</p>
               <p>Hatred is a Paſſion of the Rational Soul, which how oppoſite ſoever it be to the gentler Paſſion of Love, has its Riſe from it: For he that loves a thing with vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, doth with as great vehemence hate
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:100787:72"/>
whatſoever, is deſtructive of the thing he loves. If therefore our Love be regular and well grounded, our Hatred of what is contrary thereunto will be no leſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable: But of all ſorts of Hatred, that is leaſt allowable which terminates upon the Perſon, eſpecially when a Man is ſo fat tranſported as deliberately to contrive his Ruine; and of this kind we meet with too frequent Examples amongſt great Perſons and Miniſters of State.</p>
               <p>Calumny is nothing but a more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed and Artificial Hatred: But of all Calumnies that is the moſt venomous which ſeems to be accompanied with ſome ſhew of Kindneſs; it licks only that it may have the better advantage to bite. Of this kind, is that of thoſe who ſhall give a Liſt of the ſeveral Virtues of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but in the Cloſe they ſhall tell you of ſome ill Quality which defaces all that was ſaid before; and this in all likelyhood will gain Belief and Credit with the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, foraſmuch as the Relator ſeems to be very well affected towards the Party of whom he ſpeaks. Others there are who attribute all the praiſe of a good Action to Fortune, or diminiſh from its Worth, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a ſilent Shrug, or by comparing it with that of ſome Perſon of greater Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, in reſpect whereof 'twill appear
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:100787:73"/>
very Diminutive and Inconſiderable. There is a Detractor who ſeems much to lament the Failings and Imperfections of him he intends to traduce: Have you heard, ſay's he, what a Diſgrace is fallen to ſuch a Man? I am heartily ſorry for it, in troth, for I had a great Kindneſs for him, and I will tell it you as being my particular Friend, upon Condition you will keep it ſecret. Now the Knave by this means doth not only take away all ſuſpicion of Hatred, and ſo makes the Report to ſeem more True and Impartial; but by enjoyning Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy, he begets a greater Curioſity in the Perſon he ſpeaks to, to inquire into it, and makes him more uneaſy till he has reveal'd it to others under the like Seal of Secrecy, and thus at length it comes to be whiſper'd every where, without any poſſibility of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tracing out the Original of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor.</p>
               <p>As Jealouſy is the worſt part of Love, ſo is Envy the worſt part of Hatred. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred has ſomething generous in it, for as much as it dares avow it ſelf to the World, and bids Defiance to the party 'tis offended with: Whereas Envy is Timerous, and conſequently Treacherous: For Men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy thoſe only whom they dare not attaque openly, and ſuch as are above them upon ſome account or other, whether of Nature
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:100787:73"/>
or Fortune: Hence we ſee that old Folks, deform'd Perſons, Baſtards, with ſuch like Perſons as are ſubject to the Defects of Nature, are moſt prone to Envy: Alſo thoſe to whom the World hath been leſs favourable, are inclinable to envy others who get above them. Likewiſe Women are more liable to this black Paſſion than Men, eſpecially when there is matter of Competition, whether it be for Beauty or Bravery. Envy therefore is a tacit Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Mind towards thoſe whom we believe to enjoy more good Things than they do deſerve. Now the things which properly kindle this Paſſion, are not the Goods of the Mind, for we do not ſay that ſuch a one is unworthy to be Juſt, or Temperate, and ſoforth, but they are the Goods of Nature, and of Fortune, as Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Strength, Honour, Riches, Preferments, and the like. We are apt to be mov'd with great Indignation, and ſometimes not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly too, when we ſee Men riſe to great Place without Induſtry or Merit, but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Flattery, Corruption, or ſome ſuch baſe Means; ſo that generally ſpeaking, all ſuddain Tranſlations from a low to a high ſtate of Life, whether by ways Honeſt or Diſhoneſt, do naturally move us to Envy, which doth ſeldome or never diſquiet us when we look on thoſe who have for ſome
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:100787:74"/>
time enjoyed the Favours of Fortune; Time and Poſſeſſion ſeeming to give them a juſt Title: So that Envy in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth imply Imbecillity as well as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity; but the greateſt Miſchief which it works, is commonly on the Party it ſelf in whom it Reigns; for it never ceaſes to Torment and Prey upon him, till like a Viper it at length gnaws through the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els in which 'twas bred.</p>
               <p>Emulation ſeems to have ſome Analogy with Envy, but it differs in reality from it, for as much as Envy is an Indignation againſt another meerly becauſe he poſſeſſes ſomething which is good: But Emulation doth not ſo much envy another the Good he enjoys, but is rather angry with it ſelf, becauſe it cannot arrive to the like: Upon which account it kindles in us many Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Actions to obtain the ſame; ſo that thoſe who are ſubject to Emulation, are generally young Men of great Hopes and Spirit, and ſuch as are Endued with many noble Qualities.</p>
               <p>Deſire and Averſion are Branches of Love and Hatred, and both of them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Abſence of their Object: Deſire being nothing but an Inclination or Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the Will towards ſomething which pleaſes in Proſpect; as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary a Coercion is an Abhorrence or
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:100787:74"/>
Diſlike we have of a thing upon the firſt Appearance: So that Flight or Averſion do ſuppoſe a Man to have never had a feeling of what doth diſlike him, for otherwiſe 'tis Hatred: Whereas Deſire may be of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing we have once Enjoyed and is now withdrawn, as well as of ſomething we never yet taſted of. As Joy doth always preſuppoſe the Preſence of its Object, either in Reality or Imagination; ſo Deſire is a Motion or Paſſage towards an Object which is not yet obtained, and yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs Deſire is frequently accompanied with Joy, from that Power of the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which many times doth repreſent the thing as already obtained: Nay this Joy of Deſire is ſometimes more Affecting than that of Fruition, not only from the ſmall Reliſh we have uſually of things we are actually poſſeſs'd of, but from the Force of Imagination, which doth ſhew things grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to our Thoughts than they are in Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>

               </head>
               <p>HOpe and Fear are Paſſions of the Soul which have their Converſation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with things to come; of which the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is an Apprehenſion of a future Good, with a Probability of obtaining the ſame; the later an Apprehenſion of ſome future Evil, with a probability of its falling on us; which Evil may be Twofold, either of Senſe and Pain, or of being deny'd ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is in our preſent Poſſeſſion, or what we may hereafter enjoy. So that both theſe Paſſions always give motion to two other Paſſions, as their Inſtruments, <hi>viz.</hi> Deſire and Averſion, or that which the Schools call Flight.</p>
               <p>If we conſider the Perſons who are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to theſe Paſſions, we find that Youth is very prone to Hope; thoſe of this Age being Vigorous, and having little or no
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:100787:75"/>
Experience of Buſineſs, or of the Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which do croſs it, conceive they are able to Conquer any thing they undertake, and this many times without ever adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Means to the end, or ballancing the Difficulties with the Poſſibility of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting what they do deſign. Hope there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in them when it is in the Exceſs, and beyond all natural Cauſes for Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becomes many times Preſumption, tho we uſually call ſuch Perſons deſperate, but improperly: for Deſperation is a Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty diametrically oppoſite to Preſumption; being the deſertion of a Deſign, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with an utter Ruin and Deſpondency of Spirit. Moreover Preſumption acts Spontaneouſly, Deſperation by Conſtraint. The <hi>Romans</hi> in their Moneys deſcrib'd Hope under the form of a young Virgin, whoſe Garment was long, thin, and looſely flying in the Wind, holding a green Herb of three Leaves only in her right Hand, and ſtanding on Tiptoe; all which did amount to this Signification, that ſhe did belong to Youth, that ſhe was Volatile or in Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of a Nature which was ever Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, Springing, and riſing up on high.</p>
               <p>Fear is the effect of Puſillanimity, and incident to old Men: For beſides that Reſt which is natural to that Stage of Life, we find that ſuch from the long Experience
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:100787:76"/>
they have had of the World, and of the Diſappointments they have met with, are very ſcrupulous in weighing all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Action, and their Nature al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo being cold, ſluggiſh, and unapt for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, they are preſently apprehenſive of Difficulty and Danger, and by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of Fear. 'Tis true, the Deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Experience of old Age, when it is joyn'd with the Courage of Youth, cannot chooſe but raiſe a well grounded Hope; and yet we find Examples ſometimes, where Boldneſs in the Undertaker has ſupplied Conduct and Counſel. Such was the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> in his Invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Italy:</hi> He was a Prince but of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty three years of Age, and therefore of no Experience; He was deſtitute of Money, for he was forc'd to borrow a hundred thouſand Livers of a Banker of <hi>Genoa,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could march out of <hi>France;</hi> after that being at <hi>Turin,</hi> he borrowed the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and at <hi>Caſal,</hi> thoſe of the Marchioneſs of <hi>Monferrat,</hi> both which he pawn'd for Eighty thouſand Crowns, all which was ſpent preſently. He was deſtituted of Men, having but eight Thouſand in his Army, and laſtly, he was deſtitute of Counſel, following only the Perſwaſions of <hi>Stephen de Vers,</hi> who had been ſometimes his <hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:100787:76"/>
one <hi>Briſſonet,</hi> as obſcure a Fellow as the former. In this ridiculous Poſture did he March, having no other General in the head of his Army, but his own impetuous and youthful Spirit. All the World ſtood amaz'd at his bold Attempt, but they were much more amaz'd when they ſaw him entring into <hi>Florence, Rome,</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> in a Triumphant manner, Routing the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> alſo, with all the Confederate Strength of <hi>Italy,</hi> in the Battle at <hi>Fornova,</hi> where three thouſand Men lay dead upon the place, with five Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Gonzaga;</hi> all which was bought with the loſs only of thirty or forty <hi>French.</hi> The Conqueſt which <hi>Alexander</hi> made of <hi>Aſia,</hi> was better projected; for he was provided with well diſciplin'd and Veterane Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, with Money, and all other Military Equipage, and yet the Means held no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion with the Event. 'Tis true, ſuch early and precocious Bloſſoms, never ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to any great Maturity and Growth, and are ſubject to infinite Hazards, for twenty miſcarry for one that ſucceeds: Nay we find that Neceſſity and Fear do many times atchieve greater things than Hope. Such was the brave Action of <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon,</hi> who tho he were not bred a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, yet with a handful of Men, made his Retreat good againſt all the Forces of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:100787:77"/>
                  <hi>Perſia,</hi> the Difficulties of unknown Ways, and the Miſeries of a Winters March; and ſuch was the Victory which King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth of <hi>England</hi> had over the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Argencourt,</hi> where all the Terms of Peace being refus'd him, and all means of ſafety cut off, there remain'd nothing but the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Deſtruction to give Courage. Courage when 'tis ſurrounded with inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble danger, by a kind of Antiperiſtaſis takes heat from cold, and uniting its force turns to Lightning and Thunder.</p>
               <p>Fear is ſaid to be a betraying of the Succours which Reaſon offers. Upon this account ſome are bad Sollicitors of Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: they dare not ſay or contradict any thing, and if they be upon the neceſſity of making a Requeſt, they do it with ſo ill a Grace and ſneakingly, that by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding they teach men to deny. Others, as <hi>Cauſin</hi> very well obſerves, are timid in Converſation, and feel a Conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the Approach and Preſence of qualified Perſons. Their Diſcourſe is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Connexion, their Words are broken, their Voice is trembling, their Colour chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and their Countenance ſhrunken and dejected. This happens oftentimes to Young People, thoſe eſpecially who are of little Experience, and timerouſly Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and yet in ſuch 'tis for the moſt part no
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:100787:77"/>
more than baſhfulneſs, and will wear off up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on advance of years; though we may obſerve ſometimes that Men of Parts and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, when they happen into the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of others, who are of more Eminent Worth than themſelves, feel a damp upon their Spirits, and upon the ſuddain turn Cravens. This was that which the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Augur</hi> endeavour'd to make <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> believe, that though he was da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and brave enough, yet his Genius became degenerate and impotent whilſt <hi>Ostavian</hi> lookt upon him; and therefore he advis'd <hi>Antonius</hi> to quit <hi>Rome,</hi> and all occaſions of ſeeing him; though 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable this fancy was laid hold of by <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra,</hi> that ſhe might make her Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour the more willing to continue with her.</p>
               <p>It hath been obſerv'd that great Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies have been apt to raiſe a fear in Men of greateſt Abilities. <hi>Cicero</hi> who mov'd and turn'd the moſt <hi>Auguſt</hi> Audience of the World, with the volubility of his Tongue, trembled always and was pale when he began his Harangues. The great Importance of the buſineſs which did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon his management, might proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly cauſe his Fear. <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> is ſaid to have had the like defects, and had ſcarce power to raiſe his Spirits.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:100787:78"/>
Boldneſs of Speech muſt be confeſs'd many times to be of great force in Popular Aſſemblies, for the empty Veſſel will make the greateſt ſound; we may obſerve of many how they begin like Thunder, ſeeming as it were to ſwell with Oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Triumph in the Pomp and Tours of their Orations, and yet in reality their Notions are generally very trivial, being ſet off with Geſt and Twang; whoſoever therefore is baſhful and of a timid Addreſs, and yet carries the Cauſe, muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd to be a Perſon of ſingular Abilities; and ſuch a one was <hi>Pericles,</hi> who Labour'd always under much Confuſion when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſpeak in Publick, fearing leſt any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety of Phraſe might ſlip, or any word be miſplac'd, and yet <hi>Pericles</hi> was one of the moſt abſolute Orators <hi>Athens</hi> ever produc'd. At this day the greateſt Preachers beyond Sea, are in greateſt dread when they are to Preach before a Convent of <hi>Nuns;</hi> for ſuch Religious Women being generally Perſons of an Ingenuous Education, and employing much of their time in Reading, become mighty Criticks of Language, and (according to the humour of their Sex) ſtand more upon the Delicacies and Puncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio's of Words, with Elegancy of Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than upon pertinent and ſolid No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:100787:78"/>
Fear as it is the moſt Slaviſh, ſo is it the moſt Commanding Paſſion of the Soul. Hope, as I ſaid before, does raiſe it ſelf upon the proſpect of Fruition and Rewards, but Fear's encite us upon the apprehenſion of loſs and pain: Now the apprehenſions of Pain being far more quick and laſting than thoſe of Reward (for Good is ſcarce perceivable in the very Fruition) it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows Naturally that Men are far more apt to be byaſſed by the former than by the later. 'Tis painful to endure, 'twill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive you of Liberty, and of all Worldly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, 'twill deſtroy your Health &amp; Life, are Motives far more pathetick and prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than to ſay, it 'twill make you Rich, 'tis Reputable, 'twill make your Name fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous to Poſterity. And upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I am perſwaded, that the Gallows makes more Men honeſt than all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Lectures or Conſiderations of Credit and Fortune whatſoever; where a good Action may Entitle a Man to certain loſs, ſome there are indeed but not many of that Metal, who will Embrace the later, for the Reputation which attends the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
               <p>Fear which is deſtitute of all Hope turns to Deſperation; and here the Neceſſity does many times put Men upon very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and hazardous Attempts. 'Tis
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:100787:79"/>
not ſafe therefore to force an Adverſary to the Walls. There is ſcarce an Animal ſo fearful but will turn again when all ways of flight are ſtopt; and the bitings of dying Creatures we know are not without Venom.</p>

               <p>AS Hope and Fear follow Deſire and Averſion, ſo Joy and Sorrow follow Hope and Fear; all the former Paſſions of which I have hitherto diſcours'd, ſeem to fix in theſe two as the ultimate Scope and Conſummation of all their Motions. Joy therefore is nothing but a diffuſion or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latation of the Spirits upon the fruition of what it did hope for and deſire; as Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is a Contraction or Fixedneſs of the ſame Spirits, upon the arrival of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for which Nature hath a Fear and Averſion: This is very viſible from the Circumſtances of thoſe who are affected with theſe Paſſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:100787:79"/>
And firſt for Joy, we ſee it is expreſs'd by a cheerfulneſs and vivacity of Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, by ſuddain and pleaſing Vibrations of the Eyes, by a readineſs in a Tongue to deliver the Thoughts of the Heart, but ſtrangled in the Utterance by too great an Inundation of tenderneſs. In ſhort, the Body is lightſome, the Heart gay, and the whole Man ſeems to be nothing but Soul and Exultation. 'Tis true, ſuch vehement and ſuddain Alterations of Nature as theſe are not uſual, nor are they without danger ſometimes. 'Tis known how <hi>Sophocles</hi> contending with another of his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in an Argument of Tragedy, was in great ſuſpenſe and fear of the Event; but at length the Victory being adjudg'd to him by the Applauſe and Cries of the whole Theatre, he died immediately with joy. Such was the Fate of a Young Woman lately in <hi>France,</hi> who after many Difficulties at laſt obtain'd her Parents conſent of Marrying one ſhe had a long time Lov'd; but being to ſign the Inſtrument of Contract, ſhe had no ſooner writ the firſt Letter of her Name, but with Exceſs of Joy ſhe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſwounded, nor could ſhe ever be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd to Life again. Effects of this kind are not rare, and of which the Reaſon's this, Joy as I ſaid before is nothing but a diffuſſion of the Spirits, ſo ſtrong and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:100787:80"/>
indeed, that it ſeems to carry away the Soul with it, and endeavours to break as it were the Priſon of the Body. By this means the Heart which is the Seat of the Vital Spirits, and the Centre of Life, is left abandon'd and deſtitute of ſtrength, ſo that the Spirits not being able ſuddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to recollect themſelves, and to return to their former Station, there follows preſently a deficiency of Heart, which concludes ſometimes in a total Expiration. Great Joy is uncapable of Moderation, eſpecially in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of weak Capacities, for People in theſe Circumſtances give themſelves all the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in the World: Their Joy many times overflows with ſuch fond Repetitons, and with ſuch a perpetual Torrent of Babble and Impertinence, as ſhews ſufficiently that the Mind is in ſome Diſorder and beſides it ſelf.</p>
               <p>To ſuddain and exuberant Joy there many times ſucceeds great Penſiveneſs, by reaſon of great Expence and Perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirits which do accompany it; like the Heart from whence it ſprings, as it has its Diaſtole or dilative Faculty, ſo has it its Syſtole or Time for Contraction.</p>
               <p>There is another ſort of Joy which is more ſedate, and conſequently more laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſuch is that which reſults from a a reflection upon the courſes of a Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:100787:80"/>
life. This kind of Delight is more Natural to Religious and Perſons who are addicted to Contemplation, and generally to all thoſe who confine their Appetite within the narrow Limits of Retreat; not but that I believe Men of Buſineſs are capable of them, ſuch as were <hi>Seneca, Boethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and ſome others: Nay the benefit which the Publick reaps from their Actions, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but augment their Content; Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs Morally ſpeaking, as the great Temptations which lie before their Eyes, whether of Corruption or of Ambition, will not ſuffer them to uſe the Means; ſo where they are Men of Integrity, the great hurry and diſtraction which attends their Life, will not ſuffer them to collect the fruits of thoſe delights I am now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of: For as for Honour, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, Riches, and the like, they do not belong to the Bleſſings of the Mind, but of Fortune, and are found more frequently to be the Rewards of thoſe who trouble the Government, than of others who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally endeavour to ſerve it.</p>
               <p>Sorrow or Dolour is an Affection which as to its Moral Nature, is nothing but an act of the Mind, reflecting upon ſome E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil as already happen'd beyond Remedy; and this may be either upon the account of ſome Good we are actually depriv'd of,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:100787:81"/>
or of ſome Evil we actually ſuffer; But if we conſider this Paſſion as to its Natural Cauſe, the Notion we have of it is this: The reſentment of the Mind for any loſs, eſpecially when there is no Proſpect of Releif, begets Languor and Dejection; for the Vital Spirits or Blood retiring to the Heart, by reaſon of too much Oppletion do ſuffocate and ſtrangle that Noble Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, whilſt the outward Parts being rob'd of their Natural heat, become weak and ſeeble. Nature many times to deliver it ſelf from this Oppreſſion ſummons up all its ſtrength, as appears from thoſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Concuſſions the Body ſuffers by Sighs and Tears, by beating of the Breaſt, wring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Hands, with ſuch like Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms as do demonſtrate a great Agony and Perturbation. And yet upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Extraordinary Grief, we find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very little or no external Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for in ſuch caſes all the Faculties of Nature ſeem ſtupified and totally extinct. I have heard of one who took the loſs of his only Child which he lov'd moſt tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with great ſilence, who yet upon the Report of a Servants death, for whom he had but a ſmall or no Concern, burſt forth preſently into Tears: he ſeeming in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to be like a Veſſel fill'd with Water to the Brim, which upon the leaſt Infuſion
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:100787:81"/>
of any new load immediately runs over. There is a difference betwixt Grief and Sadneſs; it is Sadneſs when we have a Proſpect of the Evil to come, but Grief when the Evil is actually upon us.</p>
               <p>As Joy is not without its Clouds of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, So Sorrow is not without its lucid Intervals: at leaſt any dawnings of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort affect the Perſon very much, who is the Subject of Sadneſs. One who has for a long time pin'd under a dangerous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, is more affected with the ſmalleſt returns of Convaleſcence, than another who does paſs his Life in a Proſperous courſe of Health. As Spring naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows Winter, ſo the ſmalleſt refreſhments of the one, are made far more ſenſible by the ſmartneſs and tediouſneſs of the other. Upon which account the wiſeſt of Men have ever ſtudied to ſet off their Delights by a voluntrary ſearch of ſomething that was painful and laborious, and he ſeem'd to be ſomething more than a Heathen or a Philoſopher, who having ſpent a whole day without any trouble or diſaſter, began to be ſorrowful, and to expoſtulate the Gods for his Misfortunes, as believing that ſo great a Felicity muſt inevitably be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd with ſome remarkable Diſaſter. Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row which is occaſion'd from the ſenſe we have of anothers Misfortunes, is call'd Pity
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:100787:82"/>
or Compaſſion, which alway implys Love. This though it be a Commendable Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as being founded in Humanity and good Nature, yet to be too much overcome by it argues Weakneſs<hi>:</hi> For he who is toucht with every Mans Calamity, will never want occaſion to afflict himſelf, and to make his Life miſerable.</p>
               <p>Perſons who are plac'd in the Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Fortune are ſaid to be very unapt to be Compaſſionate, and they are of two ſorts. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Thoſe who live in the height of Proſperity; for they think themſelves exempted from the Calamities which fall uſually upon other Men, ſo that they can have no ſenſe of that which they never felt, nor which they believe they ſhall never feel; as being out of all appearance of being reduc'd to the ſame Terms of Miſery. The other ſort of Men who are deſtitute of Compaſſion, are thoſe who are overwhelm'd with Calamities; they think their own hard Fate is ſufficient for them to bewaile; nay they rather take Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to themſelves, when they meet with others who are Companions with them in the ſame diſtreſs. They then who are in the middle Region of Fortune are moſt prone to this Paſſion, and they are either ſuch who have ſometimes ſuffered the ſame Diſaſters they condole in others, or ſuch
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:100787:82"/>
as fear at leaſt to be in a poſſibility of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into the ſame themſelves. The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives which excite this Tenderneſs are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally two: either the Conſideration of ſome heavy and unuſual Calamity which falls upon another, or a Conſideration of ſome unjuſt Puniſhment inflicted upon an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Perſon: for as for thoſe who are Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals or of an Infamous and lewd Life, we little regard their ſufferings.</p>

               <p>ANger like the other Paſſions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſeveral Objects and Degrees of Provocation, may be either Good or Evil. <hi>Firſt</hi> then we ought to have regard to the Nature of the Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which may be ſmall or none in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Perſons who give it: For if it be not accompanied with a Malicious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, or if it be given by ſuch as are deſtitute of Senſe and Underſtanding, we ought to make little account of it: hence it is that we are not much concern'd at
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:100787:83"/>
the Diſtaſtful and Opprobrious Words of Old men, Madmen, Women, Children, Sick People, and the like; becauſe ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have either really a leſs ſhare of Reaſon than others, or elſe being under Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers or Defects of Nature, their Reaſon is in a great meaſure extinguiſh'd, ſo that they deſerve our Pity rather than our Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnation.</p>
               <p>In the next place the Provocation may be very inconſiderable in reſpect of the thing it ſelf, and upon this account it is, that the greater part of Mankind are really Fools or Madmen, ſuch <hi>viz.</hi> who upon every little Triflle fly out into Paſſion and Complaint. This Lady becauſe her Woman by leaving the door open let out the little Dog, frets and laments her Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs, Crying out that never any one was plagu'd with ſuch Servants. That Gentleman becauſe his Man brings his <hi>Perrique</hi> when he calls for his <hi>Cravat,</hi> falls a Curſing and Swearing at him, and perhaps Reforms him with a Kick. The miſplacing a pair of <hi>Gloves,</hi> or a <hi>Key</hi> or ſome ſuch trifle, is ſufficient to make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to bemoan their Misfortune and the Tediouſneſs of Life.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place the Provocation may be conſiderable, and yet our Anger become
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:100787:83"/>
vicious by too vehement a Tranſport<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This makes the moſt Beautiful Features to appear Deform'd, it makes the Veins to ſwell with Poyſon: 'Tis this ferments the whole Maſs of Blood into a <hi>Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> and ſtrains every Vein with Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Morally ſpeaking, a Man may and ought to reſent a deliberate and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Injury. He who patiently ſuffers one, 'twill not be long before he rececive ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For malicious Men (and ſuch make up the greater part of Mankind) will ſtill Aſſault where they find the leaſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and he who is only Eminent for Paſſive Fortitude, will not only be eſteem'd a Coward which is the greateſt Obſtacle to any glorious Action; but by being that Tame-fowl, from which every one may pluck Feathers, he will at length be made Naked and Miſerable, and be Obnoxious to perpetual Torment of Life. To prevent which Miſchiefs, a Man ought ſometimes to chaſtiſe an Injury, yet ſo as not to run out of the Pale and Circles of Reaſon, by yielding up himſelf to the Indiſcretion of the Furies. In this Caſe an Enemy has a double Revenge upon him, for beſides the Injury he offers him, he cannot but take Pleaſure to ſee him foaming at the Mouth, to behold him Raging with Indignation, and as much as
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:100787:84"/>
poſſible to turn his own Executioner, ſo that the <hi>Stoicks</hi> were much in the right, that the Evil which a Man does create to himſelf by Anger, is much more hurtful to him than the Injury which he receives from another. He therefore who can command his Paſſion, does not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure great eaſe to his own Merit and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, but gives a Wound alſo to his Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who is then moſt afflicted when he finds that he makes the leaſt Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: for he levells his Arrows againſt an Impenetrable Rock, by which they are ſhiver'd to pieces, without other da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage ſave that the Splinters are many times repell'd back upon his own Face who ſhot them. <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> the famous Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing-Maſter of old, when any Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars came to learn his Art, propos'd this to them for their firſt Leſſon, <hi>viz.</hi> To Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate and ſubdue their own Anger, giving them this Reaſon: For Anger, ſays he, looks only where to ſtrike, but not where to defend. Every good Swords-man will play always to a Guard, that ſo his Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon may be ever in a poſture to ſave him, though he miſs his blow. The truth of it is, an Angry Man as he is the moſt uncapable of all others to defend himſelf, ſo is he for the moſt part very unable to offend ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for breathing nothing but preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:100787:84"/>
he has no leaſure to think of the moſt ſuitable means for it, or to reſpite the Execution to a convenient Time. Moreover by diſcovering his Intentions by Menaces, he gives his Adverſary notice to provide himſelf.</p>
               <p>As Anger form'd into Choler is moſt diſadvantageous to the Perſon in whom it rages, ſo does it render him alſo more ugly and deform'd in the ſight of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder than any other Paſſion whatſoever. His Eyes like thoſe of a <hi>Serpent</hi> are Red and Fiery: his Countenance either Pale, or Flaming, his Lips are foaming, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and livid; his Voice ſhrill, his Words inarticulate, and his Speech abrupt. He ſmites his Hands one againſt the other, and the Ground with his Feet. In a word, all the Features and Airs of his Countenance are miſerably defac'd, all the Motions of his Body are undecent, and all the Thoughts of his Soul Brutiſh and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage; ſo that as a Man can never fall into theſe Fits without great Torment to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and loſs of Reputation, ſo let it be obſerv'd alſo, that theſe Fits never go off from a Man, but they leave him miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly drooping and dejected. This High-Tide has a Low-Ebb ever ſucceeding it: For th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:100787:85"/>
there follows nothing but Laſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Cowardlike Diſpoſition, in ſo much that the nicking time to fall upon a Man is immediately when his Choler is over.</p>
               <p>As old Age and Sickneſs do very much incline to Choler, ſo alſo does over-much Faſting: It may Mortify other Vices, but it feeds this: For we may obſerve how that the ſame Man who at another Time would be all pleaſant and good humour'd, has a kind of Acrimony and Eargerneſs upon his Spirits, and is moſt impatient under the ſharp hazards of Thirſt and Hunger. There is no coming near a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry <hi>Lyon,</hi> which when full can hardly be provokt. Thoſe therefore who have known themſelves liable to this Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and when they have been to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon any diſquieting buſineſs, have look'd upon it always as the beſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to repleniſh themſelves to ſatiety before-hand, that ſo their Spirits might have ſomething to feed and faſten on. This may ſerve as an Antidote and for Prevention, but in Caſe a Man ſhall actually be exaſperated, the beſt Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is to ſuppreſs the inward Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as much as poſſible, or to give the Diſtemper an eaſy Vent, and 'twill wear

away by degrees. His Conceit was not unpleaſant, who being ask'd by another that was over ſubject to Anger, by what means it might be Cur'd, ſent a Bottle of Water with aſſurance, that by holding ſome of it in his Mouth one quarter of an hour, it would have a good and infallible effect. The Party tries it and finds it true, and being very ſolicitous to know its Compoſition, his Doctor told him ſmilingly; that 'twas not from any Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in the Water, which was only Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Elementary, but from the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and the Compreſſion of the Mouth, which did accompany the taking: For by that little ceſſation Anger was Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated, and Reaſon in a great meaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd.</p>
               <p>'Tis Remarkable what is Reported of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Emperour, who upon an Affront which he received by the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Antioch</hi> in pulling down the Statue of the Empreſs <hi>Placilla,</hi> gave Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his Officers to take a moſt ſevere Revenge. Upon the point of Execution one <hi>Macedonius</hi> an old Hermite, who Inhabited in the Mountains, and a Man very mean for Perſonage and half Naked, but of great Sanctity, ſpeaks to them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner: Go, pray, and tell the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:100787:86"/>
Emperour who ſent you; that as he is an Emperour, ſo alſo that he is a Man: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let him not look altogether at the former, but let him caſt his thoughts a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle towards the later and conſider; that as he is a Man, he does rule others who are partakers of the ſame Nature with himſelf; let him conſider alſo, that Man is form'd after the Image of God, and that the Indignity offer'd to the Image, does by reflection fall upon him that Made it; ſo that if he had reaſon to be incens'd for the Indignity offer'd to the Statue of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Wife, much greater reaſon will God have to be incens'd at the Injury which ſhall be done to his own Image; let him alſo Conſider the vaſt difference that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a living Image and one of <hi>Braſs,</hi> as alſo that it was in their Power to make a thouſand Statues in the place of that one which was defac'd, but that it was not in the Power of the Emperour, nor of any Mortal man breathing to make a Hair of the Head, much leſs to reſtore Life to any one who ſhould dye by his raſh De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree: All which being Reported to the Emperour, his Anger was appeas'd, and changing his Reſolution he receiv'd all to Mercy.</p>
               <p>The braveſt Hero's of the World have been ever thoſe who could ſubdue their
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:100787:86"/>
own Anger. <hi>Hannibal</hi> was a bold and brave General, but withal Bloody and Cruel, whereas <hi>Scipio</hi> who overcame him would by no means hearken to the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of Revenge, which might have prompted him indeed to have turn'd his Arms immediately againſt his Enemy, but by a vaſt Conduct he transferr'd the ſame into <hi>Africa,</hi> and was ſo ſlow in all his Marches, that ſome ſtick not to Reproach him with Sloth and Cowardiſe, and yet by this diverſion he both preſerv'd his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in forcing <hi>Hannibal</hi> to follow him, and in the end totally Defeated the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians. Lucius, Sylla</hi> and <hi>Catiline,</hi> were men of undaunted Souls, and made up of Fury; they valued not being hated, ſo they might be but fear'd, nor car'd they to ſacrifice all Mankind to Revenge, and to bury the World in Ruins, ſo it might help Ambition into the Throne, which though they fail'd of, yet they obtain'd their Ends, I mean their own Deſtruction; whereas <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus</hi> no leſs Ambitious than the former, carried all before them, for beſides their Martial Proweſs they were men of great Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and ſo obtain'd to the Empire of the World by that which they had over their own Wills and Paſſions. They were always in a Condition to take Counſel, and to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:100787:87"/>
chooſe the fitteſt means, Conquering more by their Courteſie than by their Swords: For it was obſerv'd by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that he meaſur'd his Bounty ever by his Victory, <hi>ex qua nihil ſibi vindicavit niſi diſpenſandi poteſtatem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Injuries which Men generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent moſt, are either ſuch as concern, Firſt, their Perſons; 2ly. Their Eſtates, or laſtly their Reputation, any one of which is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to impreſs Nature with a vindicative Inclination, eſpecially when there is ſome Salt of Wit mixt with it, ſuch as carries a ſhew of Contempt, than which nothing can be more piquant and ſtinging. And yet ſome brave Men have had that Aſcendent over themſelves, as really not to be concern'd for ſuch Affronts: which calls to my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance the behavior of that brave Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, I mean the late famous Mareſchal of <hi>France,</hi> Monſieur <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing along one of the Streets of <hi>Paris,</hi> his Coachman being ſomething careleſs drave ſo near upon a Gentleman, that he receiv'd ſome ſmall prejudice by the Dirt that was caſt upon him by the Horſes: This provok'd him to give the Coachman the Baſtinade; whereupon <hi>Turenne</hi> looking out, the People all flockt about him bare-headed, withal telling the Gentleman who it was that he had affronted, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:100787:87"/>
what Puniſhment he might expect; at which the Gentleman nothing daunted, made his defence by laying the fault upon the Coachman. Such an Affront and eſpecially in <hi>France</hi> would have oblig'd a meaner Perſon than that General, to have taken a ſevere Revenge, which yet he did not; but without alteration either of Voice or Countenance, he ſuffer'd the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who offer'd him the Injury to depart, with a Caution only to be more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for the future.</p>
               <p>And as touching private Perſons 'tis good for them upon occaſion of Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to make it known to the World, that their Patience proceeds not from Cowardice or Puſillanimity, but from real Virtue<hi>:</hi> For if there be any thing of the former in it, 'twill draw on infinite Injuries. 'Tis better therefore to own a Reſentment betimes, than by receiving Continual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations to give Encouragement for more without End or Meaſure; when a Man's Metal therefore is once prov'd, 'tis Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity not to ſuffer himſelf to be beaten out of his Repoſe by Anger (eſpecially if he be his Inferiour who does provoke him) nor indeed will there be ſuch frequent Cauſes for it.</p>
               <p>There are two Conſiderations by which
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:100787:88"/>
a Man may in a very great Meaſure allay the Extravagance of this Paſſion. The one is, by reflecting upon his own Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the Time paſt, and upon the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions which kindled this Intemperance and Heat: For by this means he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly find that generally they were but trivial; that he himſelf was very much in fault; he had too vain an Opinion of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and too mean Thoughts of another: yet the Words and Actions which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf return'd back were greater than the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, and all about nothing, or at the moſt but ſome ſmall inconſiderable diſguſt, which he might have qualified with very ſmall addreſs, or at leaſt, that it could never put him in ſuch Diſorder ſhould the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ever happen again. And then let him be aſſur'd alſo, that whatſoever ſeems troubleſome to him at the preſent, will after the Expiration of a few days appear altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Fooliſh and Irrational as any little paſt diſguſt; and thus by rating things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent by what is paſt; he will be able to diſcern what Meaſures to take, there being the ſame Reaſon and Proportion in both. Another Conſideration upon which a Man may be drawn to moderate his Anger, is for him to view himſelf in the behaviour of other Men under the ſame Circumſtances, and there he will
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:100787:88"/>
eaſily ſee how Extravagant moſt Men are under ſuch Diſorders, which his own Treacherous Fancy will not ſuffer him to Conſider in himſelf.</p>
               <p>As for Revenge, it is not a Species of Anger, but the Execution of a Deſign which Anger had premeditated and form'd: If it be Proſecuted by the hand of a Publick Magiſtrate, it is not ſo much Revenge as Juſtice; if it be done by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen force with reſpect to the foregoing Injury, it is ſimple Vindication only, which may be more or leſs Evil accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſeveral degrees of Provocation; but if it be done openly with ſhew of Pleaſure and Content, 'tis Cruelty: and if it be done ſecretly and under a diſguiſe, 'tis Treachery.</p>

               </head>
               <p>FRom the Will and Paſſions proceed we to the other Capacity in which the Bleſſings of the Mind principally conſiſt, as being the Nobleſt Faculty of the Soul, the Underſtanding. The Gifts and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which I have hitherto Diſcourſed of, are in a great meaſure common to Beaſts<hi>:</hi> They have Senſe and Memory many of them in very great Perfection; they are Capable of Love, Jealouſie, Anger, Revenge and Fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as well as Men, and are exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hereunto, as moſt Men are, by a kind of <hi>Impetus</hi> from the Images, which ſeveral Objects draw upon the Imagination. Nay there are many Inſtances to prove that they have a Power of Election and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; but for Intellectual Gifts they are of a Sublimer Nature: For by theſe Men are in a great Meaſure qualified with the Perfections of Incorporeal Subſtances. The Underſtanding has the vaſt World for
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:100787:89"/>
its Object; it ſearches into the Nature of every thing from the dark Centre of the Earth to the higheſt Heavens; it enquires into the Motion, Native Form, Dimenſions and Effects of thoſe Glorious Luminaries: It ſtands upon the Convex of the World, and looks into that vaſt Abyſs or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſe of Imaginary Space which ſurrounds whatſoever is finite, and is it ſelf immenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: it follows Angels in their Motions till it arrives with them to that firſt Pure and Eternal Original of all things, the ever Glorious and Immenſe Creator.</p>
               <p>Now the Operations of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are either Solitary, and ſuch as reſt bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a Knowledge of the Nature of things; or elſe Directive, when like a Soveraign it Commands the Inferiour Faculties, and appoints them what to do. 'Tis true, as the caſe now ſtands, the Inferiour Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties do for the moſt part Rebel: they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther follow their own Inclinations, or if they do impart them to the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they do it only as to a Confident not as to a Counſellour. Whereas the Method which Nature does propound is this: When an Object excites the Will, the Will preſents it to the Underſtanding to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of it, and according as the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding makes the Judgment, ſo the Will proceeds to Execution by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:100787:90"/>
of ſuch Paſſions as are conducing thereunto.</p>
               <p>The Operations of the Underſtanding are infinitely more Sublime and Perfect than thoſe of the Will, not only for their Spirituality, and for the Greatneſs and Variety of their Objects, but alſo for the Tranquility which goes along with them. The Will cannot act without great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation and Conflict of Paſſions; but the Acts of the Underſtanding are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd and without Noiſe, though they be not without Difficulty, Conſidering the fallacious Informations we have of things. They are reduc'd to theſe three general Heads. Firſt, <hi>Science.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Judgment.</hi> The firſt conſiſts in a particular Diſquiſition of the Nature of things. The Second in a more Confus'd and Univerſal Survey of Nature, the laſt in guiding the Will and Paſſions in the Affairs of Life.</p>

                  <hi>SCience</hi> is of two ſorts.

A Second Branch of <hi>Science</hi> is that which is called <hi>Logical,</hi> or Ratiocination, being nothing but an Art of proving one thing from another by ſuch ſuitable Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums as are apt to win upon the Mind and Reaſon of the Hearer. And firſt for Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy plain and Obvious as the Principles of Nature ſeem or ought to be; ſo it is, that all our Errors and Miſapprehenſions of things, are reduc'd to this one Ground and Fundamental Error, <hi>viz.</hi> our Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their firſt Cauſes: Witneſs that great Diverſity and Extravagance of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions

touching the Original matter of all Sublunary Bodies. <hi>Thales</hi> the <hi>Mileſian, Pindar,</hi> and the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Prieſts would have it to be Water: <hi>Anaximenes</hi> affirm'd it to be Air: <hi>Parmenides</hi> and the <hi>Stoicks</hi> are for Fire: <hi>Pythagoras</hi> reſolv'd all things into Numbers, <hi>Empedocles</hi> into the four Elements; <hi>Plato</hi> into God and Matter, the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> into Matter and Form; and laſt of all <hi>Epicurus</hi> and <hi>Democritus</hi> held that the four Elements, together with all the variety of mixt Bodies, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from the Fortuitous Conflux of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs Atoms, all which being of divers Figures, after a long and impetuous Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, met at laſt into one Maſs or Globe of Matter.</p>
               <p>From this Obſcurity of the firſt Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of things, it happens that even the plaineſt Informations of Senſe, which are as it were the Foundations of all our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, become very intricate and deſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table upon a ſtrict and ſubtile reſearch of Reaſon: what's more obvious to our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes than Quantity, yet what's more imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible to our Underſtanding than Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or the Compoſition of continuance: for either it is diviſible into infinite Parts, or into finite only; if into infinite Parts then muſt it contain infinite Parts, but for the finite Quantity of an Inch for Inſtance,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:100787:91"/>
to contain infinite Parts is impoſſible. If we ſay it is diviſible only into finite Parts; let us ſuppoſe for Example the whole Number of Minute Parts or Atoms into which a Line of an Inch may be divided, to amount to one thouſand: Now let us enquire of the firſt, ſecond or third Parts, and ſo of the reſt, whether they poſſeſs the ſame Individual Space or no? and if any two of them do poſſeſs the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Space, then can they make no Extenſion, and conſequently the ſecond and third, as alſo the third and fourth Parts, and ſo the reſt of them can make no Extenſion, which deſtroys the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis. But if any two Parts as A. and B. for inſtance, touching one another poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs a larger Space than either of them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally, then 'tis plain that ſome part of B. does not touch A. and conſequently B. and ſo the reſt may be ſubdivided into other minute Parts (contrary to the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis) <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe by which they touch, and thoſe by which they do not touch, which Subdiviſion may be Multiplied in <hi>infinitum;</hi> ſince we can never reſolve the Compoſition into that definite Number of Parts, concerning which the ſame Difficulty will not return as at the beginning: From all which theſe Abſurdities will ſeem to follow; firſt that an Inch is as long
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:100787:92"/>
as an Ell, or a Part as big as the Whole, ſince both are Eternally diviſible into infinite Parts. Secondly, That the Finger or Needle of a Watch which moves the breadth of a Barly Corn, and a Ship which ſails a League in the ſame ſpace of an hour, move both of them with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Swiftneſs, ſince the breadth of a Barley Corn is diviſible into as may Parts as the length of a League, and there being the ſame common Meaſure of an hour for both theſe Motions, they muſt be equally ſwift; for things are ſaid to be equally ſwift when they meaſure equal Parts of Space in equal Parts of Time. Upon ſuch like Subtelties as theſe it was, that a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher undertook to prove there was no Motion, Arguing thus; Whatſoever moves, moves either in the place in which it is, or in the place in which 'tis not: not the the later, for Motion is in the thing mov'd, which cannot at the ſame Time be in the place in which 'tis not, without a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; nor yet the former, for Motion is a Tranſition from one place to another, which cannot be whilſt the Body remains ſtill in the ſame inidvidual Circumſcription of Space; but the Sophiſter having a Bone put out of Joynt, was made ſenſible of his Fallacy as well as of his Pain, when the Surgeon told him, the Bone was not
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:100787:92"/>
out of its place, for either 'twas put out of the place in which it was, or out of the place in which it was not; not the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, for nothing can be out of the place in which it is; nor yet the later, no more than a Man can be ſaid to be put out of <hi>Rome</hi> where he never was.</p>
               <p>Again, what's more Univerſally diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and obvious than Light, yet what's more difficult to be underſtood, <hi>viz.</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ſomething or nothing? It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be an Accident according to the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Philoſophy: For either the ſame Numerical Light which was in the Sun, is derived to us by way of migrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which this Philoſophy explodes, or elſe there are ſo many new Generations, as there are Points of Space in that vaſt Tract of <hi>Aether,</hi> which lies betwixt the Sun and us, both which ways of Propagation are utterly inconſiſtent with that Swiftneſs of Motion by which the Light is conveigh'd to us, ſome hundred thouſand Miles in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. Beſides, the Sun Beams being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refracted or reflected from a Glaſs do generate Fire, and therefore muſt chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the Nature of a Subſtance, for no Accident can acquire the Nature and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of a Subſtance by Condenſation. But if we ſay that Light is a Subſtance, the ſame Difficulty will ſtill return con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:100787:93"/>
the imperceptible Time, in which 'tis propagated ſo many thouſand Miles: We ſhall be at a loſs alſo to underſtand how the Sun by ſuch a continual Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its Subſtance over ſo vaſt a Sphere ſhould not be diminiſh'd; alſo, why up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Suns Setting the ſame Subſtance does not continue viſible; alſo being Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial how it can poſſeſs the place of other Subſtance without Penetration, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite other Impoſſibilities which follow what way ſoever Reaſon turns it ſelf. The ſame Difficulties alſo occur in our Enquiry into the Nature of Colours, of Viſionary Images, and the like.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place for Senſation, we gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally deſcribe it to be the Impreſſion which an Object makes of its Image or Species up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Nerves where by the Adminiſtration of the Animal Spirits, it is conveigh'd to the Brain or Common Store-houſe of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. This at firſt ſight ſeems plauſible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to deſcribe the manner by which theſe Operations are made; and yet upon a cloſer purſuance of Reaſon, 'twill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be nothing but Juggling and Jin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle; For if we enquire how the Impreſſion of Touch, for inſtance, is made upon the Nerves we are at a puzle: As for the <hi>Modi Entium</hi> and ſuch like Terms of Art, they are but Words of Conjuration, which ſerve
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:100787:93"/>
only to make the thing more Myſterious and Obſcure. Our Senſe tells us, whether the thing we touch be hard or ſoft, hot or cold, moiſt or dry: Now if Senſation be nothing but an Impreſſion upon the Animal Spirits, I would gladly have a Deſcription of theſe different Impreſſions of hard and ſoft, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein they do conſiſt; and whether the Spirits thus affected fly immediately to the Brain, or whether they Conſign over their Impreſſions to other Spirits, or theſe to others, as it were conveighing the word from hand to hand till they arrive at length to the laſt Sentinel of Senſe. From all which 'tis Evident, that the further we dive into Nature, the more we are in the Labyrinth. Now if things with which we are ſo well acquainted, ſuch as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, Motion, Colour, Light, Heat, and all the Objects of Senſe, all which are lookt upon as the firſt Principles of Nature, and are to be judg'd conſequently ſo obvious to our Knowledge, as to be underſtood upon the very Propoſal of them, as it is in the Principles of <hi>Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;</hi> I ſay, if theſe things be ſo obſcure and inextricable, no wonder if the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations which we draw from them be many times fallacious, ſince the Premiſes naturally are more clear and certain than the Concluſions which are derived from
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:100787:94"/>
them, and yet how many rare Diſcoveries in Phyſick, in the Matkematicks, in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Philoſophy, in Husbandry, and in the whole Latitude of Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are deduced from theſe Beginnings, which ſhews the Excellency of humane Reaſon, that with admirable Art and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, is able to Erect ſuch great Fabricks upon ſuch uncertain Principles.</p>
               <p>But beſides all this, there is another Branch of Science in which the Sagacity of humane Reaſon is highly engag'd, <hi>viz.</hi> Ratiocination. Its Method does com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence from ſome known Maxime to which all Men do aſſent, and from thence by a Rational Progreſs of Connatural Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums, we proceed to further Inferences, till at length we arrive to the Mark pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd: I ſhall give an Example in Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; would I prove Man to be a free A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, I would Argue thus; God is Juſt, therefore he is Juſt in the Diſtribution of his Rewards and Puniſhments, which cannot be true, unleſs we have a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to obtain the Rewards and avoid the Puniſhments, which alſo cannot be unleſs we have a free Power to Act or not to Act. This way of Arguing is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative and direct. Now the ſame thing may be prov'd in another Form by the way of Reſolution, thus: If the Will be not
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:100787:94"/>
free, then is it vain to Attempt to do Good or abſtain from Evil: If this be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Rewards for the Good to which we are neceſſitated are undue, as the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments inflicted for the Offences we are oblig'd to commit are alſo unjuſt; And Laſtly, if this be granted, then God who Rewards the one and Puniſhes the other muſt be alſo unjuſt; but God is Juſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all theſe Conſequences are falſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Will is free.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Logick</hi> or the Art of Ratiocination has two Parts: The firſt is called Invention, where the Underſtanding hunts after ſuch Topicks or Mediums as are ſutable to prove the Point. The other part of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi> Conſiſts in ſuch a Management of the Mediums as is likely to gain Aſſent, and this is done by reducing the Matter to ſome certain Forms of Argument, which we call Syllogiſms, by which the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is ſo drawn by the Links of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that it cannot poſſibly ſtart away, nor be liable to Error. There is alſo another Property of Ratiocination, which is to Conſider the Condition and Capacity of the Perſon to whom it makes Application, ſince the ſame Topicks will not win Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief upon all alike: but this Conſideration more properly belongs to <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> whoſe Office 'tis to perſwade, and which works
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:100787:95"/>
rather upon the Wills and Paſſions of Men though not without ſome Maſtery upon their Underſtanding; hence it is that theſe two Sciences are near Allied, the one fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Matter, the other Ornament for Reaſon, both which are high Points of Knowledge, and require Men of mature Years to make Profeſſion of them; ſo that to begin with theſe Arts in the Inſtruction of Youth is very Prepoſterous; for as it has been obſerv'd by Learned Men, there being no Ripeneſs of Underſtanding in that green Age, all the Precepts of Art will degenerate only into puerile and crude Forms of Sophiſtry and Cavil.</p>
               <p>It ſeldom happens where three or four are in Company, but that they have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Sentiments of the ſame thing, when yet the Object is indifferently repreſented to all. All indeed will pretend to the ſame Light of Reaſon, and all of them make the ſame Application of one to the other, ſo that the ſame Rule being applied to the ſame thing, there ought to be the ſame account of the Meaſure, but it falls out otherwiſe, and chiefly for theſe four Reaſons: The firſt is Emulation. There are few Perſons but take a Pride to diſplay their Feathers, nor can the heat of Converſation be long ſupported but by banding the Point from one to another. A ſecond Reaſon is, the Inequality of Mens
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100787:95"/>
Intellects, which differ according to their ſeveral Educations, Temperaments and Ages. Now Truth being nothing but a Conformity of a thing to the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Inequality of this Rule muſt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Lines which are drawn by it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times very unlike and unequal alſo. A third Reaſon is, Prejudice, which is either founded in Affection or Hatred, or in an overvalue of what we are related to, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be our Friends, or our Native Country, but above all, the Prejudice we have from Cuſtom and Education ſeems invincible. A fourth Reaſon is, Intereſt, which is of wonderful Influence to biaſs Men in Matters of meer Belief, witneſs the ſeveral Engagements they lie under from the ſeveral Opinions of Religion.</p>
               <p>The Art and Maſterſhip of Reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts Principally in theſe two Points. <hi>Firſt,</hi> A quick Notion and Apprehenſion of a thing. <hi>Secondly,</hi> A Faculty to make the ſame Notion inteligible to others. As for that deſultory Wit which leaps from one thing to another, 'tis not of ſo great uſe; it ſeems to render a Man accompliſht, and being Natural to thoſe of Younger years, is taking in Company if it be not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd out of Time, and with Affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Some Men are of ſo happy Parts, that upon any Emergency their Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will ſupply them with Matter to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:100787:96"/>
upon, ſo that they cannot hold, but like a Torrent they let fly to give room to new ſucceeding Notions; and in this kind we find many Eminent Perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe of the long Robe, as Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Orators, and Lawyers, who tho they ſometimes deliver themſelves in ſet Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues, yet thoſe of them are rather Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in their way, who can make an Addreſs to any Perſon or Auditory as occaſion does require; which Extemporary Performances are very Charming, eſpecially when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd by a Perſon of good Preſence and of a twanging Tongue. Nor can a Man make ſo ſolid a Judgment of theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances being oblig'd to let go what's before him, that he may receive new Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations from the Speaker, whoſe voluble Tongue flows upon him in freſh utterance, of Senſe without pauſe or reſpite. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs ſuch Diſcourſes when they come to be receiv'd at leaſure by the Eye, are found to be thin, Superficial and without Sinews and Connexion, whereas others who digeſt their Conceptions by long and continual Meditations, are infinitely more ſolid and accurate. <hi>Phidias</hi> was ſome years in making of a ſingle Statue, but then he wrought for Eternity.</p>

               </head>
               <p>ANother Grand Operation of the Soul is Contemplation, which though it be a Pleaſure which is to be found only in Solitude, yet is it not a ſolitary Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, being accompanied with two other, <hi>viz.</hi> Health and Tranquility. They are the two Hand-Maids of this Miſtriſs, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their perpetual Attendance on her, but by reaſon alſo of their Virgin Purity and Innocence. All other Delights are adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate, being for the moſt part acquir'd with Expence and Hazards, and ſuch as weaken Nature, and nauſeate in the very Fruition; whereas theſe render the Conſtitution more Vigorous, and never diſaffect the Appetite by any mixture of Bitterneſs, or by being too Luſhious: they are adequate to all the Dimenſions of Man, Health being the greateſt Felicity of the Body, and Tranquility the greateſt Bleſſing of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:100787:97"/>
the Mind. He who feels himſelf in an even Temper and enjoys an equal diſtribution of his Native Heat without pain and languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; he whoſe Paſſions are all appeas'd, or, what is better, in Subjection: He who is remote from the noiſe of Buſineſs, or from what's more clamorous, the Terrours of an Evil Conſcience. He who is at peace with all the world and with himſelf too; He, I ſay, is the only Man, who is capable to taſt the Pleaſures of a Contemplative or rather of an Angelick Life. When the Sea is in Agitation, and when Clouds and Vapours hover over it, the Vices we have are but ſhort, undelightful and obſcure; but when all is clear and ſerene, then is it that the ſame Sea looks like the Vaſt Plain of Cryſtal, there is a luſtre in its Surface, and the diſtant Clouds and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montories which we ſee add a Beauty to the Proſpect. Contemplation then is an Art of a becalmed Mind, beholding ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Objects at once with delight and wonder. Here we ſee the admirable Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Oeconomy of Nature in all its Productions and Periods, in all its Seaſons and Revolutions: By this we Conſider the Celeſtial Bodies, how they are almoſt infinite in Beauty, Number and Greatneſs, how they are wonderful in their Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and how they are moſt Rapid, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:100787:97"/>
and perpetual in their Motion. How we may Contemplate the great Variety of Creatures, their ſeveral Vertues and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and their mutual Subſerviency to one another. We may obſerve one great Concordance and Harmony which runs through all the Parts of the Univerſe, and how things inanimate and ſenſeleſs are moſt Regular in all their Tendencies, whilſt man the Maſter-piece of the Creation, is for the moſt part Brutiſh in his Deſires, Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant in his Actions, and many times moſt miſerable in his End.</p>
               <p>By the help of this Proſpect we may obſerve the various Methods of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Governing the World, in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Good out of Evil, and in making Circumſtances of little Moment to be able to give Birth and Progreſs to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Actions; we may obſerve how wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men for the moſt part flouriſh, and how the good are commonly deſpis'd and miſerable, from which inequalities of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments in this Life, we are incited, to take a Proſpect of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; it being rational to Conclude, That the Juſt and Supream Governour of all Things, who has Circumſcrib'd his meaneſt Creatures with ſuch Laws of Nature as may not be Tranſgreſs'd, will not be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent to rectifie Diſorders of greater Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:100787:98"/>
and ſince he does not do it in this life, it remains that there is another State where Proſperous Impiety ſhall be Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and a Perſecuted Innocence be Crown'd. By this Scale of Viſibles, Contemplation leads us to ſome thing that is Inviſible, <hi>viz.</hi> to that Supream Power which gave the firſt Being to every Creature, and which is as it were the firſt Spring which ſets the Wheels in Motion: for ſince no Creature has a Being from it ſelf, but from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, we muſt either make an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite progreſs in aſſigning Efficient Cauſes, which is impoſſible, or elſe aſcending by all the Links and Gradations of the Creation, reſolve our Enquiry into ſome one Firſt Cauſe, which is in it ſelf without Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and conſequently muſt be Infinite, which can be no other than God.</p>
               <p>Now from the Order, Beauty and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which we obſerve in the whole Frame of Creatures, the Contemplative Perſon has ſome Dawnings of the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent and Superlative Beauty which is Natural to the Creator. The truth of it is, our humane Weakneſs, and the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence we have on Senſe, can give us but a faint apprehenſion of things Immaterial and Inviſible: But could we once break through thoſe Clouds which ſurround the Soul in this State of Impriſonment, I
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:100787:98"/>
doubt not but that we ſhould find the Luſtre of the Divinity to exceed the Brightneſs of the Sun, by infinite more Degrees than the ſame Sun Tranſcends the pale light and Glimmerings of a <hi>Glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm.</hi> Could a Man who was born blind be reſtor'd to Sight, with what wonder and delight would he behold that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Objects with which Nature is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd, but when he ſhould conſider that all the Beauties which lie before his Eyes, are conveigh'd to him by the light of the Sun, and that all the Productions and Orient Colours of Nature, receive their Original from its Beams, with what admiration and raviſhment, would he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to fix his ſight upon this glorious Luminary of the day? Such doubtleſs will be the ſurpriſe of the Soul in relation to the Divine Beauties of its Maker, when it ſhall be freed from thoſe groſs Organs of the Body by which it is now confin'd. One while 'twill melt with langour and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, by and by 'twill ſpring forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Extaſy, and as it were lanch it ſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this Object of Immenſe Perfection. 'Twill preſently forget all theſe flowery-fading Pleaſures it met with in the Body, 'twill plunge it ſelf into the Abyſs, where Fruition will not exclude Appetite, becauſe the Faculty will ſtill be enlarg'd to re-receive
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:100787:99"/>
greater Meaſures of untaſted Joys, and ſo by an infinite Progreſs and Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of new Beatitudes, 'twill ever advance it ſelf into Perfection, till like a drop of Wine caſt into the Ocean, it ſeems to be made Immenſe by its Diffuſion, and to be rendred Conſubſtantial with the very Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity. 'Tis with good reaſon that the Schoolmen determine the Beatitude of a ſeparate Soul to conſiſt in the new Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Knowledge 'twill meet with by looking upon God, who is as it were the Centre of Repoſe and Reſt in which all the Rays of Objects meet, or rather that Mirrour in which all the Images of things whether poſſible or Created, are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented at once without Confuſion: For ſince the nobleſt Faculty of the Soul, is the Intellect, the Felicity of the Soul muſt be meaſur'd by ſomething which bears a Proportion to this Nobleſt of Faculties, which can be nothing but Knowledge. Now if it be true, that the Soul in ſeeing God as in a Mirrour, ſees all the Images of things both paſt and future as preſent to the Divine Mind, what an Infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Objects muſt there be to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an Illuminated Spirit, all which can never be repreſented to us under leſs than an infinite Duration? Such will be the Entertainment of a Beatified Soul after
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:100787:99"/>
Death, and of which we have a foretaſte in this life by Contemplation, the effects whereof have been ſometimes ſo dazling, that many Holy men have Pray'd to God to moderate ſuch Favours, the weakneſs of Nature not being able to ſuſtain the luſtre of ſuch Illumination. But theſe are to be lookt upon as the extraordinary Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of an Elevated Mind, and ſuch to which Men cannot eaſily arrive by their Natural Abilities and Strength.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXI. <hi>Of Judgment.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE laſt grand Operation of the Soul is Judgment. One who has a Speculation of Things, and of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods for effecting of them, may yet want Courage and Addreſs to Execute. No Man therefore can be ſaid to be judicious, who knows not the Art of Management, nor can a Man know this but by actual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and a juſt Application of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Wheels of Buſineſs to one another. Judgment therefore in the Notion I here propoſe, is nothing but a rational eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome End for the attaining where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we make uſe of ſuitable Means, Glorious Actions being ever the productions of Deliberation and Thought. Now Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment differs from Ratiocination: For firſt, it conſiders its Object as inveſted with the Notion of being good and eligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and conſiſts in ſome Moral Action,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:100787:100"/>
whereas Ratiocination reſts only in the Verity of what's propos'd without any relation to Good or Evil: Beſides, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocination is a ſolitary Act of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding only, whereas Judgment is an Act of the Underſtanding deliberating up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what's propos'd to the Will, and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in its choice: This therefore muſt be allow'd to be the greateſt and Nobleſt Act of the Soul, even greater than Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which though it be Converſant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a higher Subject, yet is it but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and confus'd. It does not weigh things with that exactneſs and attention, and is beneficial only to the Perſon who Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templates; whereas this weighs things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt things, and by a minute Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all their Circumſtances, makes a Calculation of their Value: It ſummons up all the Faculties of the Soul, and ſets them upon Duty, and like a Soveraign it does Encourage and Controul them in their Motions, and in concluſion it is uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Publick by being the Standard of Juſtice, and the very Baſis upon which all Laws are founded.</p>
               <p>The Judgment which we make of things Good and Evil is either ſuch as relates to the private uſe and benefit of him who Judges, or ſuch as relates to the good and welfare of the Publick. In relation
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:100787:101"/>
to a Mans particular Concerns, I give it the Name of Prudence; in relation to the Common good of others, I call it Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now ſuch is the State and Condition of Man in this life, that we cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him as ſurrounded with an Infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Objects, cloath'd in the Colours of Good and Evil, all which the Will either embraces or avoids according to the ſeveral bents and propenſions of the Paſſions. Some Men there are indeed (if I may call them Men) who let fly at every thing that occurs to Fancy. Not conſidering the fatal Conſequences to which their Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh and giddy Appetite does expoſe them. The enjoyment of a momentary Luſt may gratifie a preſent ſally of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when the Miſeries depending on it are many times perpetual. Others deny themſeves in preſent Enjoyments in order to a future good, which Method though it be prudent and rational, yet if the thing propos'd be diſhoneſt and unlawful, the Judgment deviates in the choice of its end, how Cautious and Prudent ſoever it may be in projecting at the Means. Thus he who riſes up early and ſits up late, who Travels from place to place, and eats the Bread of Carefulneſs, that he may obtain his Neighbours Lands by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvention and Fraud, or that he may
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:100787:101"/>
proſecute Revenge upon his Enemy, tho he manage his buſineſs with never ſo much Prudence and Circumſpection, is really a Fool as well a Knave, ſince the Pleaſure or Profit propos'd will never make amends for the trouble he undergoes to arrive to it, much leſs for the Penance he muſt endure after the expiration of his Enjoyment. He then is really Prudent who meaſuring his End by the Rules of Honour and Honeſty, and making a juſt computation of the force of his own A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, as alſo of the diſcouragements he ſhall meet with, notwithſtanding ſets for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward upon his Journey, and maugre all the Pleaſures which may retard him, and the pains he actually endures, does purſue his Courſe through all the Windings and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricacies of Fortune, with a ſteddy Courage, till at length he arrive to that which firſt gave life to the Undertaking. Now the more remote ſuch an Object is from our view, and the more difficulties there are to ſtruggle with, the more Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and Heroick is the Enterpriſe. We drink the bitter Potion with a Guſt upon the belief we have that it will procure us Health. And the Soldier, the Mariner, and generally all ſorts of Men, each of them endures hardſhips in his ſeveral Courſe of life, nay they make ſuch hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:100787:102"/>
to be the Subjects of their choice upon the proſpect they have of a durable Enjoyment. Now if Health, Honours and Profit can inſpire us with Noble Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, Virtue certainly ought to have as great an Influence upon our Wills, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we conſider the Pleaſure which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies its Exerciſe, or the Reward which follows the performance of it.</p>
               <p>There is another ſort of Judgment which the Mind of Man makes of things in relation to the general good of others. This does not conſiſt barely in a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what is beneficial for Mankind, but it implies a Practice and Execution proportinable to that knowledge which I call Government. This is of two ſorts, either Civil which conſiſts in the Inſtitution and Preſervation of a Kingdom by wholſom Laws; or elſe Military which conſiſts in the defence of a Kingdom by ſtrength and force; for as for thoſe who Fight for the Enlargement of Dominion, for Empire and Glory, as did <hi>Pompey, Caeſar, Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> and others, how brave ſoever they may ſeem to be, they are but more il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Robbers, compar'd to them who engage to defend their Country againſt a forcible and forreign Invaſion. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make a more particular deſcription of the Virtues of ſuch a one, I mean a General of an Army, whoſe charge doubleſs is the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:100787:102"/>
moſt weighty and Heroick of which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature is capable, being ſuch as does require a conſtant travel of Body and Mind, a vigorous Intention of every Nerve and Faculty of the Soul, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Converſation with danger. What a vaſt Proſpect ought ſuch a one to have of the Expence and Iſſue of the War, what diligence ought he to ſhew in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Levies, and what Providence in his Disburſements? At the ſame time he thinks how he may conveigh his Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from remoter Parts, and how he may intercept, or at leaſt hinder the Recruit of his Enemies; and in order hereunto he thinks with himſelf what Allies are to be Embrac'd, what Poſts to be ſecur'd, and what Inſtruments are fitted for every At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. He Conſiders what Advantages or Diſadvantages may ariſe from the Wind or Sun, from Hills, Woods or Rivers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A ſmall deſpicable Eminence or Declivity of Ground, is ſometimes the ſafety or the ruine of an Army. He is ſwift but regular in his Marches, and deliberates how to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench himſelf ſometimes in one Form, and ſometimes in another, according as the Circumſtances of the Place or the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Enemy do require; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all before he begin to Fight, he ought to conquer, I mean himſelf, by not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering his Thoughts to be diſcover'd by
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:100787:103"/>
any Tranſports of Paſſion, or Alteration of Countenance, taking heed not to loſe the Affection of his Army by ſhewing too much Rigour, nor yet their Obedience by too much Eaſineſs and Clemency. He ought to uſe all Addreſs and Artifice to diſcover the Counſels of the Enemy, and to conceal his own; his Reſolutions muſt be ſteddy and quick, but withall they muſt be mature: He muſt obſerve every Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Opportunity of Action, he muſt uſe a thouſand Stratagems, and all this muſt be attended with perpetual Watchings, Marches, and Fatigues of Hunger and Thirſt, of Cold and Heat; beſides the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of Sickneſs, Mutinies, Robberies, with infinite Diſorders which follow a Campagne. Now for a Man to ſuſtain the whole Weight and Neceſſities of an Army upon his own Shoulders, to ſtrugle with all theſe Difficulties, and at one and the ſame time to have his Judgement ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed on ſeveral Things of greateſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſuch as ſeem deſtructive of one another, I ſay all this requires a Soul as well as a Body of vaſt Abilities: So that the danger of Death, and an actual En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement in Fight, is really the leaſt part of this Employ. And yet what Art is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in drawing up an Army to Battle, conformable to the Advantages of the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:100787:103"/>
Place, and the Poſture of the Enemy; at the ſame time he both deliberates and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes, he rallies and divides: He gives Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the midſt of Noiſe and Confuſion, and many times repells the whole Choice of the Enemies Forces, and the Flight of his own; by his ſingle Conduct and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. In fine, he defies Death it ſelf amidſt all it pompous Terrors of Thunder, Smoak, Fire and Blood, amidſt Cryes and Groans, amidſt Noiſe and Confuſion. Now he that does all this and more than this, ought he not to have a Mind of immenſe Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, ought he not to have a long fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of all theſe Circumſtances, together with an Elevated, I may ſay almoſt, with an Omnipotent Sagacity, by which to take his Meaſures, amidſt ſuch a Complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Difficulties, and a ſuitable Courage to Execute? ſo that if there be any Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Nature, on which Judgement joyn'd with Practice, or Reaſon with Experience, can diſplay themſelves, 'tis here. Such a one was <hi>Scipio</hi> the Great, who when his Countrey was at the laſt Gaſp, recovered it to Life again, by defeating four great Generals with their whole Armies, of which one of them had the moſt Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Army, and was himſelf one of the braveſt Generals, the World ever knew, and this in four rang'd Battels ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively:
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:100787:104"/>
and not by punick Stratagem, or the Hazards of Fortune, but by open Proweſs and Conduct, which made <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> confeſs that he was overcome, not only in Battel, but in the Name, and in the very Military Art and Science. Now if <hi>Scipio</hi> deſerv'd the name of Great for his Wiſdom and Heroick Actions, he deſerv'd that Compellation no leſs for the benefit deriv'd on Mankind by them: if he who ſaves a ſingle Perſon from Death, ought to be remembred by him who receives the Benefit, with eternal Gratitude and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, what Altars, what Pyramids muſt he deſerve, who ſaves Millions of People from Ravage, and turns their Captivity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Triumph?</p>
               <p>There are yet others who in their little Spheres are beneficial alſo to the Publick, by managing their Actions according to the Meaſures and Directions of Judgement, as Phyſicians, whoſe Practice depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Theory of the Body's Fabrick, as alſo of the Nature of Medicines, together with a juſt and rational Application of one to the other: But the little Fees of <hi>toties quoties</hi> by which theſe Benefits are meaſured, has ſomething in it which looks mean and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did. The ſame alſo may be ſaid of Lawyers, with this further Abatement only, That by virtue of their Profeſſion, they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:100787:104"/>
to defend the Cauſe of their Clients, tho' never ſo Wrong, with all the ſeeming Arguments of Equity and Reaſon; by which means Oppreſſion many times triumphs, whilſt Innocence is condemned. As for Orators, it is their Buſineſs to Commend and to Diſpraiſe, which naturaly runs them into Flattery and Invective; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, in this, as well as in the other Functions of the Bar, 'tis certain that the Profeſſors of them endeavour to inſinuate their Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to the Publick, by having recourſe to all the Topicks of Reaſon, endeavouring alſo to influence the Lives of men, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Pleaſure, Profit, and Honeſty, with ſuch like Motives as ſway and govern the Paſſions, which cannot be done, but by a ready and thorough Conception of all things tending thereunto, together with a ſeaſonable and accurate Accommodation of them to all the Circumſtances that lye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Eyes.</p>
               <p>There is this difference between Art and Judgement: The former imployes it ſelf about ſome Manual Subject only, and is acquired by long Practice and Imitation, and requires Labour of Body. A Watch, a Picture, a Houſe, with ſuch like Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Works as are derived from the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, may be made exactly, and yet the Workman may underſtand but little of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:100787:105"/>
the Reaſon of Proportions, in that way as they are taught by Mathematicians. But Judgement has for its Object, ſomething Great, as the Ultimate End of Man, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Actions, and the Univerſal Benefit of Humane Nature: nor does it conform it ſelf to this or that Method, but accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates the Conceptions, drawn upon the Mind to all the Occurrences of Perſons, Place, and Time, and with great Conduct and Patience attempts to bring its Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to a real Exiſtence and Perfection. As for thoſe who reſt only in Theorems, and in the Ideas of things, their Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be called Deſign or Projection, but not Judgement: ſince it offers to effect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and ſince theſe Projections many times when they come to be put in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, are found very Defective and Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Rules of Reaſon.</p>

For ſuch is the prejudice of Cuſtom, and ſo great are the Defects of our Underſtanding, that in all our Definitions, or the Judgement we make of things, we take our Eſtimate from the Superficies or Colour, rather than from what is Solid: For altho Merit and Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Indowments are able to create them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a good Opinion in thoſe who do converſe with them, yet they will hardly gain Reſpect unleſs they be well attended.

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:100787:106"/>
more affect the Eye of the Beholder, and do procure greater Veneration, than all his Perſonal Endowments, tho never ſo great: Such then are the Goods of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, compared with the othet Gifts of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of which we have hitherto diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>

               </head>
               <p>I Begin with Birth, which is a Privilege entail'd upon Blood, and is no more in a Man's own Power, than the very Act of Nature by which he is generated. Nay Royal Majeſty it ſelf, which is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Honour, and in a great meaſure of all the Favours of Fortune, is not able here to ſupply an Original Defect. 'Tis true it can impreſs ſuch a Stamp upon a Man, as ſhall make him capable to derive Nobility to Poſterity, but it can caſt no Luſtre back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, by making that to be of a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Deſcent, which was Ignobly Born. He therefore who comes into the World with this Tincture on him, has made the Advantage over others, not only upon the account of Precedence and Reſpect, but in relation alſo to the further Endearments' of Fortune. It ſets him half way onwards in his Pretenſions to Publick Imployments, and to the Favours of the Court. Let two Men, in all things elſe of equal Merit, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:100787:107"/>
upon the Stage, when it is known that one of them is born a Gentleman, the other not, the former will quickly meet with a kind Reguard from all, he will find an eaſy Entrance to their good Opinions, and at the very firſt Step get that point of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, which the other ſhall not attain to but with much Difficulty and Addreſs; and be his Conduct never ſo good, he will be forc'd, in many Rencounters of his Life, to hang down his Head, not without Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his Eyes, and ſome Dejection of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Upon this Conſideration many Perſons who are obſcurely born, being advanc'd to Honour, and Places of Publick Truſt, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to carry it with a haughty Air, and to overtop that Contempt which the Meanneſs of their Family might caſt upon them. This Method certainly is not good, for whether or no ſuch Deportment be able to ſuppreſs Scorn, ſure I am it will raiſe Envy, which is infinitely more perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than the former; for thoſe who De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe do ſeldom Hurt us: beſides, Contempt will wear away in time, for tho at the firſt Riſe of ſuch a Man, we look upon him as Undeſerving, yet being accuſtomed a little to ſee him in the ſame Station, our former Prejudice againſt him is taken off, and from his conſtant Poſſeſſion, we are at length brought over to believe, that he
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:100787:107"/>
has a Title to his Place: Whereas Pride even in a Perſon of the greateſt Extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will be ſure to beget Hatred, which in the end will open a Paſſage to Revenge.</p>
               <p>We have two Examples in <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory, relating to this point of Conduct. The firſt is of <hi>Macrinus,</hi> who being by Nation a <hi>Moor,</hi> and by Dignity a Knight, arriv'd to be one of the Generals of <hi>Antoninus Caracalla,</hi> whom having caus'd to be ſlain, he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the Favour of the Souldiers, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd himſelf to be ſaluted Emperor: Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore what Prejudice he was expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to from the Meanneſs of his Birth, he writes to the Senate in the moſt ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Stile imaginable. He obſerv'd to them, That ſuch as aſcended to the Throne by Inheritance, looking upon Empire as their Patrimony, were ofttimes tempted to abuſe their Power, and ſuch a one was his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Predeceſſor <hi>Antoninus,</hi> as was alſo <hi>Comodus;</hi> whereas others, who receiv'd Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from the Senate, were under per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Obligations of Gratitude. For his own Part, that he was reſolv'd to act no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without their Advice, calling them his Princes and Counſellours; and that he would propoſe for a Pattern of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>M. Aurelius,</hi> and <hi>Pertinax,</hi> who were both of them of Private Extraction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding withall, That it was much better to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:100787:108"/>
give Honour to Poſterity by a Glorious Beginning, than by Corrupt Manners and Degenerate Actions, to fully the Luſtre deriv'd from our Anceſtors. By this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he won the Hearts of the Senate, and of all the People, who welcom'd the News of his Election with loud Acclamations of Joy, and with Imperial Honours. The other Example of <hi>Maximinus,</hi> who from a Keeper of Cattel in <hi>Thrace,</hi> after a long Series of Military Commands, was advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced alſo to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: Knowing therefore that the Obſcurity of his Birth, would make him odious to the Senate, he reſolv'd with a Barbarous and Rough Hand to level all before him. 'Tis true both theſe Emperours were murdered by their own Soldiers, nevertheleſs, the former, tho his Reign was ſhort, did by his Modeſt Demeanour, take off that Reproach which lay upon him from his Birth, whereas the other, by his Imperious and Proud De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment was execrated by all the World.</p>
               <p>In later Ages we have not a more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able example of good behaviour, then Cardinal <hi>Ximenez,</hi> who being of baſe Birth, and a Confeſſor, became Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor to <hi>Iſabel</hi> Queen of <hi>Castile;</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards being propoſed by the Queen to the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Toledo,</hi> with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy he refuſed it, alledging that by the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:100787:108"/>
Acceptance of that great Charge, he ſhould purchaſe the hatred and envy of all the Grands of <hi>Spain;</hi> hereupon the Queen makes it her requeſt to the Grands them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they would do their endeavours to win him over to accept it. By this retreat <hi>Ximenes</hi> made the purſuit more hot and eager, till at length he Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, upon the aſſurance which the Grands gave him, of their good opinion of him: In fine, beſides that Archbiſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, he was Inquiſitor general, and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, and became the ſole great Favourite or Miniſter of State.</p>
               <p>'Tis true moſt of thoſe who being of low Birth, and are advanced to high Place, like men brought ſuddenly out of a Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon to the open Day become Blind, or rather are like to thoſe who being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed always to walk upon the Earth, when they climb to the Pinacle of ſome high Tower, all things under them ſeem very diminutive, whilſt they themſelves being advanced above their Level, and being not accuſtomed to ſtand ſo high, are giddy in their heads, and are ready every moment to fall down and break their Necks. But for all this, where Perſons of mean Extraction joyn Prudence to their Natural Abilities, they ever prove the braveſt Men; for they are upon a neceſſity
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:100787:109"/>
to make the greateſt Improvements of their Parts, and to uſe their utmoſt Induſtry, being deſtitute of Money, Family, Friends, and ſuch like advantages, by which other Men of far meaner Vertues, make an eaſy paſſage to their Fortunes; ſo that all the ſucceſs they can expect muſt be derived purely from Merit. We have pregnant Examples of this truth in all the Records of Antiquity, not only in Military Perſons which are infinite, but in the ſageſt Men, and in the greateſt Wits of the World; ſo that not only they who had Gygantick Bodies, but thoſe alſo who had Gygantick Souls, were many of them to be accounted but as <hi>Terrae Filij,</hi> or Men baſely born. And indeed if we have regard to the Names of ſome of the moſt renowned <hi>Roman</hi> Families, ſuch as <hi>Cicero, Fabius, Lentulus, Piſo,</hi> and the like, we may eaſily gueſs at their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, that it was from the Plough, and from the Spade.</p>
               <p>I ſhall give ſome few Inſtances more of the eminent Abilities of Perſons meanly born, confining my ſelf to Examples of the laſt Age, and to ſuch only as lie within the Eccleſiaſtick Pale. If we travel into <hi>Italy</hi> we ſhall find <hi>Sixtus</hi> 5tus. who was the Son of a Hog-herd, and from a poor obſcure Fryer, arrived to the Popedom, and really managed matters with that publick Spirit
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:100787:109"/>
and Prudence, as did declare that he had a Soul large as that of the Empire he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to. For conſidering the Shortneſs of his Reign, he exceeded all that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or after him; if I ſhould put them allto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, I think I ſhould not ſpeak too wide. If we paſs over into <hi>Spain,</hi> beſides <hi>Ximenes</hi> we have Cardinal <hi>Granvel,</hi> whoſe Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father was but a black-Smith, or ſome ſuch baſe Artiſan, yet he by his Wiſdom and Integrity acquitted himſelf with great Applauſe, through a long Train of Court-Imployments, and to his dying day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved himſelf in the good opinion of his Prince, who was one of the wiſeſt that ever iſſued out of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> If we croſs the <hi>Pyreneans,</hi> and viſit <hi>France,</hi> we have Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> who was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended of obſcure Parents, and was called <hi>Mazarine,</hi> from the Town <hi>Mazara</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> where he was born. He was ſaid to be a Captain of a Company, in the Popes Guards at <hi>Avignon,</hi> and coming in the Train of the <hi>Nuntio</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> he was taken notice of by <hi>Richlieu,</hi> and ſo by Degrees became the greateſt and the moſt proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Miniſter of State that ever that Kingdom knew; for as for <hi>Richlieu,</hi> he had more of <hi>Machiavel</hi> in him, nor was his Death lamented by the Prince and People as was that of <hi>Mazarine.</hi> If we return
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:100787:110"/>
home into our own Country, ſince the Reformation, we have that great Prelate Archbiſhop <hi>Laud</hi> for an Example, who though he died a violent, did not dye an untimely Death, ſince he obtained Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality by ſuffering for the Intereſt of his Prince, and of the Church, and like <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, was but the Forerunner to his Maſters Martyrdom. As for <hi>Wolſey</hi> his Parts were great, his Power greater, but his Pride greateſt which brought him to his Ruin.</p>
               <p>I have hitherto conſidered the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Birth with relation to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Perſons, who are denominated by it. I ſhall now conſider Nobility a little as it is a State and Portion of the Common-Wealth. The two greateſt Empires at this day extant in the World, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Ottoman,</hi> and that of <hi>China,</hi> allow no Priviledges to Birth; for by this means all Men Study by the way of Merit to apply themſelves to the ſervice of him, who has the ſole Power of diſtributing Rewards; whereas thoſe who are nobly deſcended, ſeem to come into the Word with ſome Characters of Soveraignty, and will not conſequently be over ready to take pains, for that which they are already poſſeſſed of, and of which they think they cannot well be deprived. Whether this policy of
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:100787:110"/>
theirs be good, I ſhall not diſpute; this is certain, that in a defenſive War, there cannot be a greater Obligation upon the Subject to make a vigorous Reſiſtance, and to act in Conſort with his Prince, than the conſideration not only of his own perſonal Intereſt, but of the perpetual Intereſt and Inheritance of his Family being lay'd at Stake, which happens only where Titles of Honour, and Eſtates are made heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary; ſo that here the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Policy fails, and I doubt not but that the effects would anſwer it, were the Chriſtians once the Aggreſſors. But then for Civil diſcords which may ariſe within the Bowels of the ſame Government, 'tis certain that Men will not be inclinable to rebel nor forfeit their preſent enjoyments, upon hopes of ſuch a future Fortune, which they are ſure can never be entayled upon their Off-Spring. Hence we find few or no Civil Wars in <hi>Turky;</hi> ſubject they are indeed to Mutinies, as are all tyrannick Powers, which are ſupported by an Army, and this in the Progreſs of another Age, will in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility make a gap for the Chriſtians to break in upon them.</p>
               <p>Governments therefore which are Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and Tyrannical, as were always the Eaſtern Monarchies, deſtroy Nobility, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to bring all under an abſolute

ſubjection and dependance, and to engroſs all reſpect and honour to themſelves. Alſo in <hi>Democracies</hi> Preeminence of Blood is odious, as ſeeming to qualifie Men for a Preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of Authority; hence it is that the Gentry are no where in leſs Eſteem and Number th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n amongſt the <hi>Switzers</hi> and the <hi>Dutch.</hi> The latter indeed have ſome few ancient Families amongſt them, but their Intereſt is nothing, nor do I know <hi>whether they aſſume to themſelves a Power of enobling.</hi> If we look into the <hi>Athenian</hi> Common-Wealth of old, we ſhall find <hi>Miltiades, Aristides, Themistocles,</hi> and <hi>Phocion,</hi> four of the braveſt Men <hi>Greece</hi> ever produced, all of them to die either in Priſon or Baniſhment by the Command of their ungrateful Citizens, whom they had ſo often preſerved, tho for no other Reaſon but becauſe their extraordinary Services challenged a place of Honour above the reſt. In <hi>Aristocracies</hi> where all things are governed by Senators, as in the <hi>Roman</hi> Common-Wealth of old, and in that of <hi>Venice</hi> at this preſent, we ſhall find the Nobility to be in very great Power and Splendour, but withal much more unſafe, than under a Monarchy; for among ſo many Equals, there cannot but be ſtrong Emulation and Competition, and if a Man get but ever ſo little above others, either in Point of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:100787:111"/>
or by his glorious Actions, he gives occaſion for Jealouſie, and is in moſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent danger to be ruined. This is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Caſe of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobility, and if we look into the <hi>Roman</hi> Common-Wealth, we may ſee <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> all the three <hi>Scipio</hi>'s, and <hi>Cicero,</hi> all of them baniſh't ignominiouſly by that City, which they had ſo miraculouſly ſaved from utter Ruin and Deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Nobility therefore is ſafeſt under a limited Monarchy, eſpecially where there is a Subordination of leſſer Nobles under them, ſuch as in our Language we call Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, tho in the Language of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, theſe alſo are ſtiled Noble. Theſe ſeveral Degrees or Orders are not only Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental but uſeful to Monarchy, it being obſerved that they help to break the rage and ſury of the <hi>Mobile Vulgus,</hi> before it can arrive to Majeſty. The Rabble or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People which are as it were the main Body of the State, are always apt to envy the Gentry, as the Gentry are always apt to envy the Nobility; ſo that theſe two orders, are like two Moles, which keep off the tempeſtuous Ocean, or at leaſt rebate its force very much before it can arrive to the ſeat of Empire, which otherwiſe would lie too open to the wide ſhocks of the boundleſs Flouds, when any wind of Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:100787:112"/>
ſhould blow upon the Unſtable Waters But then in caſe the Nobility ſhould grow too Powerful and Inſolent, the Soveraign may have recourſe to the inferiour Gentry or common People, who will be ſure to take Part with him; for Men ever hate thoſe who are immediately above them; by this means the ballance will eaſily be kept even, and the Soveraign Authority be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; and this ſeems to be the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over where the Commonalty is not in ſome Degree conſiderable, Monarchy is but precarious as in <hi>Poland,</hi> where the Nobility or Palatins, are in very great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and the King little more than the beſt Man amongſt them, depending as well in his Government, as in his Election on them, whilſt the Nobles trampling on the Common People as on their Slaves, and Vaſſalls, do upon the matters erect ſo many petty Tyrannies, as there are Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinats; nor can the King any way relieve them, as being himſelf tyed to the Stake, and allow'd to walk only within the Rounds and Circles of his Chain. The Prince therefore who would really preſerve his own Authority, ought not to advance the Nobility to too high a Pitch, for then they will eclipſe Majeſty, and inſult over the inferiour Subjects; nor yet ought he to let
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:100787:112"/>
them ſink too low, for then the Inferiour Subjects, who are moſt numerous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable, will grow inſolent towards them, and at length preſume to confront Soveraignty. 'Tis beſt therefore to ſettle them in the middle Region, ſubject to their Supreme, yet ſo as to be able to bridle the Unruly Multitude.</p>
               <p>There are two ways by which Nobility, and conſequently the Royal Power, is much diſparag'd. The firſt is, When Titles of Honour are proſtituted for Money, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon Mean, Unqualified Perſons, as Tradeſmen, Artizans, rich Countrey-Men, or ſuch whoſe Profeſſions or Study no way ſuit with the Obligations of Knighthood. Another way of debaſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Original of enobling and diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing Families by Coat-Armour; ſeems to be no ancienter than the Times of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly War: for the men at Arms, who were called <hi>Knights</hi> or <hi>Milites,</hi> and liſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this Expedition, every one beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified his Shield with ſome Device or Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, which was afterwards tranſmitted to Poſterity, as a Badge or Cognizance of their Anceſtors they were deſcended from. There are a ſort of Gentlemen in the World, who will glory much in their Pedigree, when perhaps their Family took Riſe from ſome Vintner or Taylor, or if they be well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, they ſeem not to retain the leaſt Relique of their Progenitors Honour, but the naked Eſcutcheon; a Race of lazy and degenerate Drones, who look Big only by thinking of another's Actions, and whilſt they envy thoſe that aſcend to Honour by ways of Induſtry and Virtue, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for the moſt part, conclude their Lives with Shame and Beggary.

               <p>IF the univerſal Conſent of Ages, if the conſtant Practice of all Conditions of Perſons, if the bent of Deſire, and the ſtrength of mens Affections, be able to make a thing Sacred, all theſe concurr in Riches, ſo that Riches may challenge a Temple no leſs than Honour, as having not only a greater Number of Votaries, but being able to purchaſe both Honour, and almoſt all the other Bleſſings of Fortune, and is that Deity, which does upon the matter, command the World. If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Events of War, we ſhall find this ſoft Mettle to have ſubdu'd as many Cities as the Sword, and if we regard the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of Peace too, we ſhall find 'tis this which dos unlock the Cabinets of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, 'tis this that does debauch their boſom-Favourites, and does undermine and blow up their Counſels.</p>
               <p>Riches may be conſider'd in relation ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to particular Proprietors, or in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:100787:114"/>
to the Publick. In relation to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, 'tis certain, That the State which is moſt wealthy, is in the greateſt capacity to ſuppreſs Civil Factions, and to extend Dominion, provided there be no want of Induſtry, or decay of Diſcipline. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of War are made and carried on at a vaſt Expence, whether we conſider the Lives of Men, or the Proviſions of the Mouth, together with the ſeveral Engines, Magazines, and all the Military Equipage: But there is this Miſchief which does uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally attend rich and flouriſhing States, <hi>viz.</hi> The Plenty and Abundance in which they live, does uſually tempt them to Idleneſs and Luxury, in which caſe the Prey invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, and the decay of Diſcipline and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, makes the Conqueſt more eaſy. Thus alſo the ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, under the diſſolute Governments of <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius,</hi> was torn in pieces by the <hi>Hunns, Goths,</hi> and thoſe other Northern and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Nations, which throng'd in daily through the Frontiers: And thus the vaſt Empire of <hi>Aſia,</hi> though extreamly rich, and abounding in all good things, by a long and proſperous Enjoyment of Peace and Eaſe, became ſo effeminate, as encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd the poor and ſavage <hi>Tartars</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade and conquer it. The Conqueſts which are made by people who are poor, are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:100787:114"/>
by Irruptions than Wars; like a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Torrent they come ſuddenly in, and carry all away before them, but if once they be repell'd, they muſt return for ſome time to recruit, being deſtitute of the means to carry on a long and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive War. But notwithſtanding theſe and ſuch like Examples, the Nation which is richeſt, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> will have the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand over thoſe who are about them; and therefore it is not true Policy for a Prince, when he finds his Neighbours to increaſe in Power, if he cannot keep pace with them by his Induſtry, to follow them with his Sword, leſt peradventure he be at length forc'd to beg for his own, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be ſtript of all, having no other Guard to ſtand upon, but that poor Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Poſture of croſſed Arms.</p>
               <p>Riches are of two ſorts: Firſt ſuch as conſiſt in the Poſſeſſion of Lands, Cattle, Corn, Fruits, with ſuch natural Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Earth, as contribute to the uſe and ſuſtenance of Man, to which I may add all ſorts of Manufactures, and the works of Art. Or by Riches we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, Money. In former times, things were bought and ſold by Barter and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, but this way of troquing, proving very troubleſome and incommodious, all men had recourſe to Money, as to the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:100787:115"/>
common Standard by which the Value of Things is to be eſtimated, ſo that he that has Money, is upon the matter, Maſter of all thoſe things which Money can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure. It concerns therefore every Man to look well to his Purſe, but eſpecially a Prince, not only becauſe he has infinite wayes, and thoſe very large ones, of ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but becauſe he hath great Enemies, both Forraign and Domeſtick, of which the later are far more dangerous. When a Princes purſe is at a low ebb, Inſolence will be high and touring, and want of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney does draw him many times to ſuch diſſimulating, and compliance, as detracts much from the Luſtre of Majeſty, which in a ſhort time will bring it under Diſabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Contempt. The ſeaſons of Action are loſt, whilſt he is ſeeking after the Means, and what is worſt of all, 'tis ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom Princes are thus reſerv'd in their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, but by ſuffering their Wings to be robb'd of the faireſt and ſtrongeſt Plumes, they ſeem for a great while after, but to flutter on the Ground.</p>
               <p>Their Cuſtoms in many places beyond Sea of having Mounts or Banks, is of great advantage to the Government, and well worthy our Imitation. All perſons who have a mind to put out their Money, may put it into the publick Treaſury, at a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:100787:115"/>
Intereſt, by which means there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a vaſt Sum in readineſs, upon any ſudden and extraordinary occaſion; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as when Money is to be rais'd by way of Tax, and with the Conſent of the Parties or Repreſentatives, beſides the forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Inconveniencies, half is loſt before it can come to the State, what with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacies of the Collectors and Officers, and what with the intolerable Exaction of Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers and Bankers upon preſent Advance. To which we may add the Delays, which attend ſuch Supplies, as well in the Grant as in the Levy, ſo that coming oftentimes too late, the Government, by this Means, lyes betray'd to inevitable Danger. And as this Expedient of Mounts or Banks is beneficial in reſpect of the State, ſo is it in the next place as beneficial in reſpect of the Subject: For there will be leſs occaſion of having Recourſe to the diſguſtful Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Taxes, and for the Creditors that ſhall place out their Money this way, 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that they will never looſe the Fruit of it, for want of an opportunity to place it out, and it is as certain too, That the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the State, will be much better than what they can expect from the perſonal Security of Bankers, or of private men, (who break every hour) or from the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty of Scriv'ners, or from any Land-Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:100787:116"/>
where the Title is for the moſt part intangled, and the Lands themſelves pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingaged by Judgements, and Mortgages, and many ſuch like ſtatutable Snares and Fetters of the Law, as may make the poor Creditor ſpend the Remainder of his Life in fruitleſs and vexatious Suits: ſo that I dare affirm that the fourth part of the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels depending in our Courts, are deriv'd from this unlucky Head. Now for the better Security of every one who ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Creditor to the Publick, 'twere not amiſs if ſome Branches of the publick Revenue, in ſuch States where the people have a Suffrage, for inſtance, If ſome Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Exciſe and Cuſtoms, or any ſuch like Impoſitions, ſhould ſtand inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for the paying of Intereſt and Capital; tho it is not much to be doubted, but that a Prince who values his Honour, or at leaſt his Intereſt, will be punctual in Diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſuch Engagements, conſidering that if once his Credit ſhould fail, it would not only put a ſtop to all ſuch Recruits, but it would create ſuch a Diſtruſt and Jealouſy amongſt his Subjects towards him, as would totally alienate their Affections, and probably their Allegiance and Duty from him. 'Tis their Practice in ſome of the Banks beyond Sea, for the Creditor to give two or three <hi>per</hi> Cent. at the putting in of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:100787:116"/>
his Money, and as much at the taking of it out. 'Tis their Cuſtom alſo in ſome places, not to repay the Creditor <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> but thoſe who have occaſion for their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, do aſſign or fell over their ſhare in the Bank, to ſome other perſons who have a deſire to place their Money there, by which Means the Exchequer will never be exhauſted by the Creditors, and there will be ſtill Summs of Money flowing in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Increaſe and Greatning of the Bank.</p>
               <p>Great are the Advantages of Navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as to the enriching of a Nation with Money. 'Twas Navigation that taught us the way to the Eaſt and Weſt <hi>Indies,</hi> ſo that they who are moſt induſtrious in this way, will be certain to poſſeſs the greateſt Treaſure. Hence it is that the <hi>Dutch</hi> are thought, by ſome, to have as much Bulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lying by them, as all the reſt of <hi>Europe.</hi> Indeed their prodigious. Disburſements du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the late Wars, towards the Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Imperial</hi> Armies, for two whole Campaignes, as alſo their own vaſt Expenſes both by Sea and Land, againſt the whole Force of <hi>Europe</hi> upon the matter, is a pregnant Demonſtration of this Truth; for ſo it was that their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and Friends were more chargeable to them than their Enemies. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:100787:117"/>
who poſſeſs the inexhauſtable Treaſures of <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> are really the pooreſt of all Nations, for being little addicted to Navigation, and being naturally Proud and Haughty, they think it beneath their Grandure to follow Merchandiſe, Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, or any Mechanick Arts, though they be ready to ſtarve; and thoſe who have Gold, are forc'd to exchange it for the Commodities of other Countries, of which they ſtand in need, having little or no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of their own, much leſs any Staple-Manufactures to barter. The Nation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which makes Profeſſion of Traffick, ought well to provide that the imported Goods exceed not the Value of the expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for otherways they muſt be forc'd to ballance the Overplus with Money, to prevent which Inconvenience there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a better Expedient, than for the People to live Temperate and Frugal: for by this means they will ſtand in leſs need of Forraign Superfluities, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what they ſend forth into other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, being more than the imported Goods they ſpend, the Overplus will come Home to them in ready Coyn; and this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly one of the greateſt Policies, by which the <hi>Dutch</hi> have raiſed their Wealth and Commerce to ſuch a vaſt State: for Waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing of Forraign Commodities but
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:100787:117"/>
what is neceſſary, and having little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their own to export, ſave Fiſh, Butter, Cheeſe, Earthen Ware, and ſome ſuch inconſiderable Merchandize, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves to a way of Trade from Port to Port, and ſo carry the Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of one Countrey into another, till they at length make the laſt Return in Money. Another way by which the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of a Nation may be preſerv'd, is, by a Severe Prohibition of thoſe Superfluous Ornaments and Expenſes, by which the Property of the Metal is totally waſted, ſuch as Embroideries, Gold-Lace, all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Gildings, as of Coaches, Leather, Swords, Picture-Frames, with infinite other things of like Nature.</p>
               <p>Things may be ſaid to be Dear or Cheap, not only from the Scarcity or Plenty of them, but alſo from the Scarcity or Plenty of the Money which we give in their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change. If we give a little Money for a Thing, we commonly ſay 'tis cheap, when yet perhaps this does not proceed from the Abundance of that Thing, but from the Scarcity of the Money which is valued againſt it. Likewiſe when we give a great deal of Money for a little of Commodity, we conclude it to be dear, when perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture 'tis not from the Scarcity of ſuch a Commodity, but from the great Plenty
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:100787:118"/>
of Money: So that in this Age all things ſeem ten times dearer than they were ſome Ages paſt, when yet this does not happen from a greater Scarcity of ſuch things, but from that great Inundation of Silver which comes in daily on us, ſince the Diſcovery of the <hi>Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place let us conſider Riches, as they may be appropriated to particular Perſons. As for thoſe who reduce all things to a Level, we referr them to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia:</hi> For as long as Men are Men, ſome will be Induſtrious, others Negligent; and the Induſtrious will ſtill be Richer than the Others. To take away therefore what is gotten by Induſtry, and to beſtow it upon the Undeſerving, is utterly to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Virtue, and to encourage Vice; for no Man will Sow in the Sweat of his Brow, that another may Reap the Fruits of his Labour for nothing. Many are the ways of Getting Riches, ſome Honeſt, and more Diſhoneſt; but of all Profeſſions, the Retailing Merchant ſeems moſt obnoxious to Cheating, as being ſupported by Lying, affirming his Wares to be Good, when he knows them to be Bad, and with Oaths proteſting that they coſt him ſo much, when they did not ſtand him in half the Price; to which we may add the Deceit of Weights and Meaſures, falſe Bills and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:100787:118"/>
Reckonings of the Book, with infinite Frauds by which they labour to adulterate and diſguiſe their Wares. All that can be ſaid on their Behalf is this; That they are Obnoxious many times to great Hazards, and Commodities being ſpoiled, or lying dead upon their Hands, they ought to make good their Loſſes out of the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which they cannot do, but by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding more than the juſt and true Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. What is got by Husbandry, and the Improvement of the Productions and Fruits of the Earth, may be look'd upon as the moſt Innocent of all Gains, it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Induſtry and Health, and tends to the Perfections of Nature: And if we look into Hiſtories, beſides the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs of old, we ſhall meet with many Brave Men, who have be took themſelves to this Courſe of Life.</p>
               <p>There are two ſorts of Men in the World, both of them in great Eſteem for Wit, which are rarely Rich. The firſt are <hi>Poets;</hi> theſe for the moſt part are Rich only in Fancy, for being Airy and Pleaſant their Company is many times ſought after, which cannot but divert them from the Purſuit of any Solid Undertaking. Beſides, being naturally Prone to good Liquor, as the proper Inſtrument to Highten Fancy, they get ſuch Habits of Expence, as does
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:100787:119"/>
much impair that Stock of Fortune they were born to; but above all, affecting Idleneſs and Eaſe, for the Muſes ever haunt the Warbling Fountains, and Solitary Shades, any Counter-change of Buſineſs, ſhuffles all their Thoughts into Diſorder; For indeed who would ever worry himſelf amongſt the Thorns of a buſy Life, who can be admitted, when he pleaſes, to the Banquet of the Gods, drink with them in <hi>Nectar,</hi> and make them to deſcend in Golden Showres? <hi>Poets,</hi> in the very midſt of Winter, can Tranſlate themſelves into <hi>Elyſium,</hi> they can build ſtately Palaces, and furniſh them too, with the Expence only of a few Verſes. There is another Sort of Men reputed to be of good Capacity, who ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom become Rich, and they are <hi>Projectors.</hi> Theſe Men are of a Genius clear contrary to <hi>Poets,</hi> for they are of a Working Brain, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways concern'd in Undertakings, and leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing Untry'd. They will ſtick at no Expence, ſtill propounding ſome Unknown, Compendious Way of getting Wealth, till at length being exhauſted in their Purſes, or diſcouraged by unfortunate Difficulties, or the Fertility of their Invention caſting them ever and anon upon new Projects, they leave their former Deſigns Imperfect, which ſome ſecund Perſon undertakes fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently with good Succeſs: for by avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:100787:119"/>
the former's Miſcarriages, and entring on the Work with freſh Spirits and a full Purſe, he does not only improve the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, but brings it, many times, to a mature Iſſue.</p>
               <p>As for them who place all their Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Poſſeſſion of Gold, they are as great Slaves as thoſe who are condemn'd to dye for it in the Mines. They are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes handling the Ore, but have never the power to uſe it. 'Tis obſerv'd of ſuch Miſers, That they are ever moſt Griping, the nearer they are to their Ends, whereas methinks, they ſhould then chooſe rather to ſpend it in procuring ſuch things, as might make the Remainder of their Life Comfortable; but ſo it is that they cleave faſteſt to their Money, when they are neareſt to leaving it, as we ever give the cloſeſt Huggs to our Departing Friends. The Reaſon why they act in this manner, how Extravagant ſo ever it may ſeem to be, is not Unnatural: For ſeeing the ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate Object of the Soul's Deſire muſt be ſomething Infinite, they who place their greateſt Happineſs in the Poſſeſſion of Treaſure, the more they have, the nearer Approaches do they ſeem to make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that Imaginary Infinity, which is the ultimate Term of their Deſire; and conſequently they will labour with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:100787:120"/>
Eagerneſs to engroſs what remains, as we ſee all Natural Motion, is ever more Impetuous and Swift, the nearer it comes to its Centre or Place of Reſt.</p>
               <p>He therefore is truly Happy amidſt his Riches, who knows how to uſe them, for beſides the Comforts they yield in procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all things Neceſſary, and Delightful for Humane Life, they put us alſo in a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to relieve the Wants of others, and to do many Acts of Charity, and Works of Publick Benefit. And as to External Reſpect, the Ignorant Multitude will ever worſhip the <hi>Golden Calf:</hi> For let a Man be never ſo meanly furniſhed with the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the Mind, if he be but Rich, moſt who are of a lower Rank, will ſtand in terms of Complyance, ſome out of Hopes of Getting; others, out of Fear of Loſing by him, for in all Diſputes, he that has the greateſt Purſe, has odds upon his ſide. Gold, tho it be ſaid to Cure ſome Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the Eyes, is capable to Blind the Sight of Juſtice, and as being the Heavieſt of Metals, may be imagin'd to be of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Weight to Turn its Scales. It can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a Friend at Court, and what is much more to be relied on in a time of Need, it can procure a Throgh-pac'd and Truſty Evidence. In a word, tho it be not Immenſe, it is in ſome meaſure Omnipotent.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXV. <hi>Of Office and Great Place.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AN Ability to do Good and Hurt, has ever been look'd upon as a Branch of the Royal Prerogative, which, as it begets in the Minds of Men a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Awe and Veneration for the Perſon in whom it is lodg'd, ſo muſt it render his Influence great, and the Perſon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Favourite of Fortune. This Power, when it moves by Springs of ones own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination only, is converſant about Acts of Grace, but when it moves with Regard to the Merits of another Perſon, it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Juſtice, and is converſant about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments. Now although the latter Faculty is that which conſtitutes a Magiſtrate, yet ſo it is, that Men who are inveſted with Power, do many times act in an Arbitrary Way, by following the Byaſs of their own Wills and Paſſions. But be the Motives and Conſiderations, upon which they act, what they will be, 'tis certain that the Character is deriv'd from
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:100787:121"/>
a higher Authority, tho that which places Men in the Eye of that Authority, is not always Merit, but ſometimes Fortune.</p>
               <p>Offices are of two kinds, either ſuch as have relation to Juſtice, or ſuch as regard the Court and Service of the Prince. From the former ſort of Offices, Men are deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated Magiſtrates, from the latter they are called Miniſters of State, tho theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are many times Tranſcendently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove other, both in Dignity and Power. In a Magiſtrate there are theſe Four Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications requiſite, of which the Firſt is, Capacity or Underſtanding, for tho Juſtice ought to be Blind as to the Merit of the Perſon, it muſt not be ſo as to the Merit of the Cauſe; and here it is that a Fool may be more Dangerous than a Knave: The later may and will ſometimes Act juſtly, for there was never yet ſo great a Knave in Office, but he did many things Commendable, whereas he that wants Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, can never diſtinguiſh betwixt Truth and Falſhood. A Crack in the Brain is never to be mended, being a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Error, which draws many others after it, whereas Corruptions of Will, and ill Habits of Life, may be and are often actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reform'd. They do not hinder Mens Knowledge of what is Right, and there are few to be found, who will act always in
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:100787:121"/>
Contradiction to what they think is Juſt. Hence it is that Bad Men, have many times prov'd good Kings, and made Whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Laws, whereas Good Men have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times prov'd Bad Kings, by too much Soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Facility and Ignorance. To Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Underſtanding, we may joyn Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in a Magiſtrate, for no Man can well tell the Iſſue of things Future, who has not made Tryal of the like for the time Paſt. Another Qualification requiſite in a Magiſtrate, is Conſcience or Integrity, this is plac'd in the Will, as the other in the Underſtanding. Partiality of Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Bribery, are two dangerous Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to Men in Place. The Judges of <hi>Athens</hi> (called <hi>Areopagites)</hi> were wont al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to hear Cauſes at Midnight, and in the Dark, to the Intent that the Profound Silence of that Seaſon might fix their Thoughts, and that they might not be drawn to Partiality by the ſight of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. But withal I know not whether they might not feel better in the Dark, ſure I am that there is more Corruption proceeds from the Hand, than from the Eye. A Third thing requiſite in a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, is Conduct, and this not only, in the Order and Management of Buſineſs, but of himſelf alſo, by keeping his own Paſſions under due Obedience. Tranſport
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:100787:122"/>
of Paſſion does puzzle the Underſtanding, pervert the Will, and precipitate Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: by it Innocence is many times op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, and Oppreſſion encourag'd. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides nothing can bring the Perſon of a Magiſtrate under greater Contempt, than to ſee him indulge himſelf in his Follies: or how can he be thought able to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the Weighty Difference betwixt others, who in the very Act of Judgement, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not compoſe his own little Capricious Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours? The laſt Character of a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, is Courage: He is the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of his Prince, and therefore as he ought to be Deliberate and Circumſpect in Judging, ſo ought he to be Bold and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute in Executing what is once Decreed. He ought not to accommodate the Rule to the Thing, but to try the Thing by the Rule. Indeed the Rule of Juſtice which ought to be made of Steel, is many times made of Lead, not only of a Metal which is Dull and Baſe, but of ſuch a pliable Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as will be faſhion'd to any thing, tho it be ſure to leave a Smutty Tincture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it. No, no<hi>!</hi> 'Tis he only deſerves the Scarlet Robe, who dares oppoſe it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Enormities of the ſame Dye.</p>
               <p>Offices of State are Flattering Things, ſuch as all men court, but few obtain. And here it is that Fortune ſhews her ſelf to be
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:100787:122"/>
a very Falſe Miſtreſs, one while Wanton and Careſſing, anon Coy and Scornful, but always Unequal and Unconſtant. Some men tumble headlong upon Preferments, as it were in Deſpight of their Stars, or rather of their own Sublunary Mixture. Others, let them Conjure by all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations, and let them Calculate for all Meridians, and let them be furniſh'd with all Natural Parts imaginable, are ſtill but the ſame poor Solitary Cyphers: like a Dog in the Wheel, they are ever Climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, but yet remain ſtill in the ſame Numerical Place, as at the firſt; the Wheel on which they rely caſts them down again, and the Reward they meet with for all their Drudgery, is no other but the Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the Spit. They make their Rounds from this Great Man to that, and after many a Servile Turn, perhaps the only Place they can procure, may be at my Lord's Table, where they may be fill'd with good meat, or with what's leſs Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial, with Promiſes, which are but an Airy kind of Dyet, being ſuch as will make a man look Puff'd and Big, but will rarely make him Fat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Boccalins</hi> Fiction is Ingenious and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, when he brings in certain Politicians preſenting a State-Compaſs and Chart to <hi>Apollo.</hi> In the former were deſcrib'd all
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:100787:123"/>
the Winds, by which a Courtier ought to Sail, in the later all the Roads and Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks were accurately deſcrib'd, together with all the Rocks, hidden Banks of Sand, and Gulphs, with ſuch like Dangers to which men are Obnoxious in a Voyage. Great was the Joy in the Court of <hi>Apollo,</hi> for this rare Invention, and happy was the man that could firſt make Tryal of it; long it was not before a <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> rigg'd out his Veſſel Top and Top-gallant, well furniſh'd he was with all things, and ſet forth too with a Proſperous Gale: ſcarce had he got a League to Sea, but he falls amongſt Rocks hid under Water, out of which being eſcap'd with Loſs and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, he inſtantly runs upon a Bank of Sand, whereupon having Recourſe to his Chart, he found neither of theſe Paſſages mark'd: ſcarce had he eſcap'd this Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger likewiſe, but he was aſſaulted with a Suddain and Violent Wind, neither was this Diſaſter noted in his Sea-Compaſs, but ſo it was that he was beaten back again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Port, ſo miſerably ſhatter'd, that he was adjudg'd to be no good Pilot, and to be uncapable of ſetting out to Sea ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. After him comes another Politician, who was look'd upon as a more experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd Pilot than the former: having pay'd a profound Adoration to <hi>Apollo,</hi> he deſires
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:100787:123"/>
his Permiſſion to try his good Fortune, but his Succeſs was worſe than that of the firſt, for his Veſſel was wrack'd, and he himſelf had much ado to eſcape naked to the Shoar: In fine, three or four more ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving try'd to ſail by the Direction of the foreſaid Chart, were all of them Split or much diſabled. At length came a Bold, Ignorant Fellow, whoſe Veſſel was ill Built, and worſe Furniſh'd, who craving Leave of his <hi>Delphick</hi> Majeſty, to ſee what For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune he could meet with, eaſily obtain'd his Requeſt, not without the Contempt and Laughter of the whole College of Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians: He takes no Notice of State-Chart or Compaſs, but following the Courſe of his own Capricious Humour, he not only avoided thoſe Dangers which the others fell upon, but was attended all along with a favourable Wind, and made a Fortunate Voyage. This unexpected Accident ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed not only all the <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> of the <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick</hi> Court, but even the Sacred Majeſty of <hi>Apollo,</hi> who preſently gave Command that the State-Chart ſhould be examin'd with more Curioſity and Exactneſs, which when they had perform'd, they found at length that it was nothing but a <hi>Chimera</hi> Fantaſtical and Ridiculous, and ſuch as would betray men to Inevitable Danger, ſhould they return to be guided by it,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:100787:124"/>
whereupon by common conſent, they threw both Chart and Compaſs out of Doors.</p>
               <p>This Fancy of <hi>Boccalins,</hi> tho it be Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and in ſome meaſure True, yet 'tis as true too, That men duly qualified, may by a good Addreſs and Conduct, very much contribute to the Advancement of their own Fortunes. By men duly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, I underſtand, Privileg'd by Birth, Education, Perſonage, Parts, Carriage, Reputation, Friends, and the like, moſt of which where they meet in one Subject, like a Conſtellation of Virtues, do progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticate an eaſie Paſſage to future Greatneſs, by following ſome certain Maxims. It was the Obſervation of that Great and Unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Stateſman in his Eſſays; That as in Nature things move Violently to their place, and Calmly in their place, ſo Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in Ambition is Violent, in Authority Setled and Calm. All riſing to great Place is by a winding Stair, and if there be Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, 'tis good for a man to ſide himſelf whilſt he is riſing, and to ballance himſelf when he is plac'd: Thus far he. This is certain, that the Art of keeping a Place is very different from the getting it, and withall much greater. As to ways of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into place, theſe following have been ever obſerv'd to have been of ſome Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:100787:124"/>
Firſt, A man ought to ſearch all fair Occaſions of being preſented to the Eye and Notice of his Soveraign. They who are deſcended from Parents, who have born Office in the Court, or from ſuch Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, whoſe Rank and Quality gives them the Honour to be always in the Preſence, have their Work half done to their Hands: but for others who come out of the Croud or common Maſs of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they have no other way to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend themſelves, but by their Merit and Actions, and this too will hardly ſuffice, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they have ſome ſure Friend, well vers'd in the practices of the Court, who may own them at their firſt Appearance, and as it were, to lead them by the Hand through that thick Preſs and Throng which uſually ſurrounds Majeſty: For the truth of it is, whoſoever ſeeks to make his Fortunes this Way, will be ſure to have Spies upon his Actions, and ſuch as will make it their Buſineſs to blaſt him in the Bloſſom; for generally Courtiers, how Smiling and Obliging ſoever they ſeem to be, are in this like ſome other Animals, who will be ſtill driving away a Stranger, tho of their own kind, when he offers to joyn himſelf to the Herd. When a man therefore has once found the Grace to be a little known, his next Buſineſs is to ſtudy
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:100787:125"/>
the Genius and Inclinations of his Prince, and thereunto to conform himſelf: Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of Humour will create an Affection, and by being in the Eye of Majeſty, he will be always in the way when any thing ſhall fall, and will have an irreproachable Witneſs of his good Conduct and Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, againſt all the Accidents of Calumny; but above all, let it not appear to proceed from Flattery, but from a ſincere Duty, and from a real Affection to his Service.</p>
               <p>There are others who proceed a way quite contrary to what is here delivered, labouring to arrive to the Favours of the Court, by openly Oppoſing the Deſigns and Inclinations of their Prince, which Method is found but too ſucceſsful in mixt Monarchies, where the Power in many things is interwove with the Suffrages of the people. I know there is this to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, That a perſon who has won from the Contrary Party, upon hopes of Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is equivalent to two, for as he makes the Party he goes over to, to be ſtronger by one, ſo he makes the Oppoſite Faction to be one leſs: beſides, he who quits a Faction, may be of great Uſe for Suppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſame, by Diſcovering Perſons, and all their Secret Cabals and Contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to which he was privy: But yet there is this fatal Miſchief in the Caſe, That for
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:100787:125"/>
one Evil Spirit that is conjur'd off in this way, there will ſucceed ſeven more and worſe than the firſt; for when men (who are but too apt to oppoſe Authority) ſhall find ſuch Courſes Proſperous, the more the Royal Bounty is exhauſted, the more will be the Oppoſition, upon the like Hopes of being taken off with further Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuities and Rewards; nay even thoſe, who are otherways of Loyal Principles, will be under ſtrong Temptations to forſake the good old Road, for the new compendious Way, which will bring them ſafer and ſurer to their Journey's End.</p>
               <p>Boldneſs has been ever look'd upon as a Quality, very requiſite in one who would make his Fortune in the Court; for where there is a Crowd, a man muſt thruſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a little forewarder to get in, or elſe be contented to ſtand without. He muſt not deſiſt for the firſt, ſecond, or third Repulſe, but always offer himſelf with the ſame Aſſurance: And if he cannot get in in at the Gate, he muſt try to enter at the Back-door; but with Boldneſs too there muſt be joyn'd great Diſcretion and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, as well in reſpect of Perſons, as of the ſeveral Circumſtances in Place and Time: he ought well to underſtand the various Intereſts and Diſpoſitions of the Parties to whom he makes his Application.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:100787:126"/>
And becauſe the Court is compounded of all Sorts of People, and all ſorts of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs are manag'd in it, he who makes his Advantages this way, ought to be well vers'd in all ſorts of Buſineſs, as well to make him Capable of any Imployment which ſhall fall, as alſo to render his own Credit greater, and himſelf uſeful to others. Moreover, he ought to be of a ſtrong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Body, being to accommodate himſelf to all Companies and Seaſons, where the Occaſion of Converſe will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times draw him into Irregularity and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs: He muſt learn to Flatter, not only Great Men, but their Servants alſo, to the very Grooms and Footmen, he muſt make his Attendance at all hours, he muſt brook all Delays, and where he is repuls'd, he muſt by all Expreſſions imaginable teſtifie his Obligation; he muſt many times diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble Affronts from Great Ones, and make a Shew of being Thankful: He muſt meet thoſe who hate him, or (which is all one) thoſe whom he himſelf hates, with a chearful and open Face, and when he ſeems to be moſt Negligent and Remiſs, then muſt he keep the cloſeſt Guard upon his Words and Actions; but above all, he muſt never ſuffer the Thoughts and Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Mind, to be read in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. He certainly, who does not
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:100787:126"/>
weigh his own Abilities, and examin his Paſſions by theſe Meaſures, will never be in Proſpect of great Matters, unleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome extraordinary Merit and Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſhall make his Service neceſſary, or perhaps his Perſon and Humour be ſound agreeable to ſome particular Fancy of his Prince. Some men are apt to fall into Choler upon every little Provocation: Others can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abſtain from unſeaſonable Railery and playing the Satyr: Others again are Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient under Delays: Others cannot refrain their Tongue, but ſpeak any thing of any Body, and before any body. To men of this Temper, Retreat and a Private Life, would be far more Profitable than Buſineſs, for let them be aſſur'd, they will never make their Fortunes, but on the contrary, they will be in a great probability of Loſing what they were before poſſeſs'd of, and of Ruining themſelves.</p>
               <p>The Rules by which Stateſ-men preſerve themſeves in the good Graces of a Prince, are many and difficult, amongſt which theſe Four are indiſpenſably requiſite. Firſt, In Converſation and Diſcourſe, never to contend with him for Maſtery, or to gain the Point. No man willingly yields his Reaſon to be Inferiour to anothers, much leſs a Prince, for this would ſet him at a low Rate. In Matters therefore of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:100787:127"/>
or in any thing which may create Emulation, 'tis good to leave him in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Victory, or at leaſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the Conteſt before it comes to Heat. <hi>Aſinius Pollio</hi> the Poet anſwered Wittily and Wiſely too, who being call'd upon by his Friends, to anſwer ſome Verſes that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> wrote of him, anſwer'd them: <hi>Non tutum eſt Scribere contra eum qui po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Proſcribere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Rule relates to Secrets, and here the Notes are two: Firſt not to be Curious in knowing his Maſters Secrets, for he who knows another's Secrets, has an Awe upon him, and has a Power to do him Miſchief. No Man, much leſs a Prince, would willingly leave himſelf at another's Malice or Indiſcretion. In the next place, if Secrets be once imparted, let him be moſt Religious and Faithful in Concealing them, ſo that it as highly concerns him to keep them cloſe, as it is important for him ſometimes to know thoſe of another; and this is done uſually ſome of theſe Ways, <hi>viz.</hi> In Drink, by Sports and Plays, in Choler, or laſtly, which is the ſureſt Way of all, by telling another ſome Paſſage of ſmall Importance, in a way of Secrecy, or by Feigning ſome Story or other, which may have ſome Affinity and Similitude with the thing he labours to Diſcover, of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:100787:127"/>
which having got ſome looſe Ends, 'twill not be difficult to Spin it all out.</p>
               <p>The third grand Point in which the Conduct of a Stateſ-man is concern'd, is Counſel. The Wiſeſt Men have ever ſhewn themſelves Cautious and Timid in this particular. Peremptory Advice lays Arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon Majeſty, and beſides the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt 'tis apt to give, by making a Subject to ſeem Wiſer than his Maſter; if the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ſucceeds well, it forces a King to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Wiſdom of his Teacher, and to become a Debtor to his Creature; but if ill, it will not fail to procure the Diſgrace, if not the Ruine of him who gave the Counſel. By a due Obſervation of this Point, it was that Cardinal <hi>Granvel</hi> flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed to the laſt, in the good Graces of King <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond, who certainly was a Wiſe and Politick Prince. He propos'd Matters in that way, as 'twas always free for the King to make his Choice: For he ſo temper'd his Reaſons, and weigh'd the Arguments of both ſides in ſuch a Meaſure, as are ſufficient to Incline the Mind, yet ſo that the Reſolution ſhould ever ſeem to be the King's proper Act. By this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, two very conſiderable Points are gain'd: Firſt, A Firm Intereſt in the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of ones Prince: Next, By making the Prince to be Author of the Propoſal,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:100787:128"/>
a Man ſtands ſhelter'd againſt all Popular Storms, in caſe his Counſel ſhall have bad Succeſs.</p>
               <p>The laſt Rule which the Wiſeſt Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have ever obſerv'd is this: Never to affect Pomp and Oſtentation in their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Life, but to make Shew ever of Modeſty, and in caſe they be Happy in what they undertake, to attribute the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to Fortune, as alſo all their Honours to Royal Bounty, and not to Private Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. <hi>Sejanus</hi> ſtands upon Record as an Example of Subtlety, for when he was moſt Intriguing, he ſeem'd to be very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different and Cold, he was always in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, yet always Acting, and when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd Drouzy, he had ever the greateſt Objects in Purſuit. It hath ever been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judg'd the higheſt Policy, for a Man to make others the Inſtruments of his Ends, and yet make them Ignorant of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, or who it was that ſet them firſt on Work: Herein imitating the Wiſdom of the Almighty, which in the Courſe of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, does work Effects contrary to the Intention of thoſe by whom they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd. As for them who make Parade, and affect Glory in all they undertake, they will never want Envy, and generally the End is this: Such as do deſign their Ruine will make the greateſt court to
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:100787:128"/>
them, and pretend to depend wholy upon their Grace and Bounty, which cannot but create Jealouſy in a Prince, and make him embrace the firſt Occaſions to remove them. Examples of this kind we have in Cardinal <hi>Spinola,</hi> under <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond, and of late in <hi>Monſr. Fouquet.</hi> Moreover, it often happens, That thoſe who make the greateſt Oſtentation of their Policy, beſides the Envy that they draw upon themſelves, are found moſt Defective even in the Management of their own Deſigns, as appear'd by <hi>Machiavel,</hi> who, with all his Trains of Maxims, was moſt Unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in his Conduct: For it hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, That Men of his Temper are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſubject to two things, which are moſt Deſtructive of all good Counſels. Firſt, they are ever upon the Ferment, and a Working, and draw upon themſelves a greater Maſs of Buſineſs than they are able to Diſcuſs. In the next place they always float in a great Abundance of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Inventions, which hinder the Proſecution of one another: Nor can they have Patience to purſue one thing home, the Fertility of their Invention ever and anon Suggeſting to them ſome new Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients. Beſides the foregoing Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, 'tis requiſite that a man ſhould be well Inſtructed and Practiſed in theſe
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:100787:129"/>
Points, <hi>viz.</hi> Aſſiduity in Attendance, a Reſpectful and Obſequious Deportment, Facetiouſneſs in Stories and Converſe, and a Conformity to the Humours and Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Prince, for by theſe we are ſure to gain Affection, which is the ſureſt Title to Favour.</p>
               <p>Negotiation or Embaſſy, which is a principal Branch of a Stateſ-man's Duty, require him to be vers'd in all ſorts of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; to be Vigilant and Active, to be Bold and yet Diſcreet, to be Cloſe and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating, and yet carry a Shew of Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneſs, and to be able to ſuit himſelf with every Genius. A man who can frame him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to all theſe Circumſtances, will not want Occaſions of being imploy'd.</p>
               <p>But beſides the Duties which every Stateſ-man ought to practiſe towards his Superiours, whether abroad, or within the Circles of the Court, there are other Duties towards his Inferiours, which he ought to have regard to in the Execution of his Office. Firſt, He ought to receive all Suitors with an Open and Unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd Countenance, yet not to be forward to engage his Intereſt but upon Special Occaſion. Nevertheleſs general Promiſes are ever to be made, for they keep men in terms of Obſervance and Devotion, and in caſe of Succeſs, the Obligation will ſeem
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:100787:129"/>
greater as exceeding Expectation, and in caſe of Failure the Diſcourteſie will ſeem leſs, and in all Caſes he reſerves his Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the laſt, being free to act one way or another, as further Circumſtances ſhall require him. It is a Maxime amongſt Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, That it is a Diminution of Authority to do that which a man may afterwards be forc'd to undo, ſo that 'tis always more prudent, to ſtrangle an ill form'd Deſign at the Beginning, than be oblig'd after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to Diſown it in Publick, or to feed it with pernicious Reſolutions and Blood.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, every Wiſe man ought to take more Regard not to do In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, than to confer Favours, for the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will ſoon be forgotten, whereas the former make a durable Impreſſion, and will be requited with Intereſt, when men are leaſt aware; which thing is ſeriouſly to be conſider'd by one in great Office, who will be ſure ever to find more Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, than Friends. In the next place, ſuch a one ought never to Exert the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of his Power, but to Manage mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by ſuch Degrees, that his Puiſſance may be unlimited, by being able always to do more, and to ſurpaſs himſelf, for a Power which is Indefinite, will in ſome meaſure ſeem Infinite. In the laſt place, let him make himſelf to be eſteemed a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:100787:130"/>
of the Poor, by ſome remarkable Acts of Juſtice and Grace: For (as <hi>Tully</hi> very well obſerves) upon the Defence of a Great Man, the Benefit terminates either in himſelf alone, or at the utmoſt, in the Effects it has upon his Houſe and Family, but in the Protection of a Poor Man, who is Innocent and Honeſt, there is an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt made in all the reſt of that Tribe, which is no Inconſiderable Party of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>By theſe and ſuch like ways it is, that Men are obſerv'd often to riſe to great Place, and to make good their Station. There yet remains a third Grand Point, in which the Wiſdom of a Statef-man moſt diſcovers it ſelf, being indeed of greater Moment than the two former, and that is, To know when to Withdraw. Tho a man enter upon the Stage with a great Flouriſh, and act his Part well, yet 'tis the laſt Scene of the Play, and a Graceful Coming off, which ſhuts up all, and gains the <hi>Plaudite.</hi> He who has proſper'd long in the Favours of a Court, and has acquir'd his full Meaſure of Riches and Honours, when he ſees Fortune turn her Reverſe or Back-ſide on him, ought to think of Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and not preſume upon his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, in withſtanding the higher Deſtinies. No Merchant who has a Veſſel richly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:100787:130"/>
and a fair Gale to carry him Home, will be ſo Mad as to ſtand out to Sea, when he ſees a Storm approaching, and there conteſt it with the Winds and Rocks, and leave his rich Cargo with himſelf to the Diſaſters of one Fatal Hour. The moſt Cunning Gameſters will ever go off upon the Winning hand, and yet the Chances of State are more hazardous than thoſe which do depend on the Wind, or the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a Dye. Beſides the Contrivance of Secret and Potent Enemies, beſides the many real Miſcarriages, which a Man of long Imployment muſt needs contract, beſides the Caſualty of a Prince's Death, which ſeldom fails to put a Period to the Fortunes of a Favourite, beſides theſe, and many ſuch Accidents, this will ſtill be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, That Princes, at their ſeveral Stages of Life or Age, are of ſeveral Paſſions and Inclinations, ſo that the Humour and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition being chang'd, upon which a man was firſt taken into Favor, he ought in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to expect a Change in Fortune, eſpecially conſidering that great Croud of freſh Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders (men of as great or greater Merit than himſelf) which are always importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Majeſty, and ought alſo to have their Turns. 'Tis Cowardiſe and Baſeneſs, I know, for a Man in times of Danger, to deſert the Service of his Prince, upon the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:100787:131"/>
account of Securing the Fortunes he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from it: No, here he ought to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice all; but withal, 'tis high Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption in him, to think his own Abilities always Neceſſary, as 'tis Folly and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for him to withſtand a Prince, when he has once chang'd his Judgement and good Opinion of him. But were there nothing of all this, even the Indiſpoſitions of Sickneſs, the Infirmities of Age, the Thoughts of Settling one's Private Family, but above all, the Thoughts of Setling a man's Self, ought to make him think of a Retreat. He who Riſes early ought to go to Bed betimes, nor are the Shades ever ſo Pleaſant, as to one who has been for a long time in the Sun-ſhine, and is tyr'd with the Travels of the Day. 'Twas a Great and Wiſe Saying of that Officer, who demanding his <hi>Congé</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi> the V. was ask'd by him the Reaſon why he would quit his Service, being then in his higheſt Grace and Favour, to whom the good Souldier reply'd; <hi>That there ought to be an Interval of Time, betwixt the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of Life, and that of Death.</hi> There ought indeed to be a time of Recollection, and indeed none require it more than Stateſ-men: They Riſe leiſurely, and Step by Step, but they do not Fall ſo. The higher they Climb, the more ſubject they
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:100787:131"/>
are to be Giddy, and if they ſtand more open to the Sun-ſhine, ſo 'tis as true too that they ſtand more open to the Winds, ſo that here the ſmalleſt Step may proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly prove a Precipice. 'Tis better for them therefore with the good Leave and Liking of their Prince, to go down ſoftly, and ſo out through the Gate they came in at, than ſtaying longer, to be turn'd out of Doors by the Officers, or perhaps be thrown Head-long down the Stairs.</p>

               </head>
               <p>MAN, who is not born to be a Solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Creature, but to be a Member of Society, is under an inevitable Neceſſity of Communicating, not only the Actions of his Life, but the Secrets of his Heart, with others of the ſame Nature with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. This reciprocal Dependance which one Man has upon another, beſides the Natural Inclination which things of the ſame kind have to Aſſociate together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets Familiarity and Confidence, which by
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:100787:132"/>
frequent Exerciſe and mutual Offices, at length creates a certain kind of Alliance, and gives reſt to that Union of Affections, which we call Friendſhip. But then ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious are the Ends of men, and ſo different from their ſecret Intentions, that what we call Friendſhip, is, for the moſt part, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Falſhood in Maſquerade, and therefore the <hi>Italian</hi> is Wiſe, if he be not Devout, when he prays to God to Defend him from his Friends, for from his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies he is able to Defend himſelf: For certainly the <hi>Italians,</hi> of all men living, have moſt reaſon to underſtand this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, there being no Nation more Cloſe or Diſſembling in managing Revenge than they,: So that when any Kindneſs is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd them, which they are not ſenſible to have Merited, they preſently ſuſpect a Snare, and ſtand upon their Guard.</p>
               <p>There are a Sort of Men, who ſeem to fall under the Character of Friends, being ſuch as would be thought Willing to Oblige the whole World. Men they are of much Familiarity and eaſy Acceſs, making al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways pompous Overtures of imploying their Power for the Service of him that makes Suit to them; nay ſo forward are they, that they will prevent the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, offering to ſpend and to be ſpent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are addreſs'd to. Theſe general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:100787:132"/>
would be thought to be Popular, and are of a Cloſe Aſpiring Nature. But Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy certainly is the man who relyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; for when once they are preſs'd to perform their Promiſe, they will find twenty little Shifts to put off the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hoping at laſt to weary out their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and yet would be ſtill thought to be very Affectionate and Cordial. And if it happen that the Requeſt (tho never ſo Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table) be ſuch as ſhall any way diſtaſt a third Perſon, they will never be brought to the Stake of Fidelity to their Words; but by a kind of Trimming and Cajoling, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with one Party, and ſometimes with another, they hope to gain the good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of both, tho in reality of neither: For long Attendance and Expectation, is able to cancel the Acknowledgements which may be due upon the Performance of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Civility: Now inſtead of this, when a Man, after all the Alurements of Hope granted upon anothers Word, and after he has digeſted all Delays, ſhall find himſelf be-jaded, by meeting a total Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Cloſe, with what Execrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will he reſent the Diſſimulation and Treachery of ſuch a Politick, Perfidious Friend. A Wiſe and Honeſt man will be cautious to Engage his Word, much leſs to give Encouragement to purſue a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:100787:133"/>
which he is either Unwilling or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to anſwer.</p>
               <p>There is another ſort of Friends which a man meets with every where, eſpecialy in fair Weather, call'd Paraſites or <hi>Timons</hi> Friends. Theſe are wonderful Officious and Fawning, always ſaying what ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſays, doing what he does, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to divert him by a thouſand little Stories and Jeſts. They are moſt Luſhious in their Flatteries, and moſt Laviſh in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations of Service and Honour. The <hi>Italians</hi> call them <hi>Calcanti,</hi> from their bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it on the Hoof from Houſe to Houſe about Dinner-time. They will hunt a Veniſon Paſty upon a burning Scent, with greater Eagerneſs and Stanchneſs too, than when the Dogs kill'd it, and will devour it with the ſame Appetite; ſo that in this ſenſe they verifie their Title to Friendſhip, according to the Letter of the old <hi>Roman</hi> Proverb, By eating with their Friends ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Buſhels of Salt, tho when any Storm or Wind does riſe, away go theſe Butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flies. But not to ſpend time in Diſſecting ſuch Deſpicable Inſects, which by Blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only, are able to Taint and Corrupt the thing they feed upon, I ſhall now come to conſider Friendſhip under other Qualifications, and ſuch indeed as are more worthy to be enlarg'd upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:100787:133"/>
Friends then are of two ſorts, firſt, ſuch to which we have Recourſe for obtaining ſome Grace, and theſe generally being in a higher Degree of Power and Intereſt than our ſelves, are called Patrons, and of this kind a man may find ſome in the Courts of Princes, by the Help of one ſure Friend called Money. 'Tis good for a Man to have Friends of this kind to ſupport his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Credit, and the more he has of them 'tis the better. Another ſort of Friends are ſuch to whom we have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe for Counſel, and whom we admit into our Cabinet Thoughts; theſe we call Confidents, and the fewer a Man has of them 'tis the better. One is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſary to make Life Comfortable; an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> here it is true, That Friendſhip, at the ſame time that it Unites two into one, Divides one into two: For he who lives with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Bonds, or rather the Liberties of Friendſhip, muſt of neceſſity make him a Sharer in the Counſels of his Breaſt, as well as in the Affections of his Heart.</p>
               <p>To underſtand the Benefits of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, we ought to conſider the ſeveral Qualifications of a Friend, and the ways by which he may be Uſeful, of which the firſt is, For Advice and Counſel, upon which account he ought to be Diſcreet, Wiſe, and Faithful, and conſequently to
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:100787:134"/>
be advanc'd in Years, Younger Perſons are Airy and Unconſtant, whereas thoſe of Maturer years are more fix'd in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and of greater Experience, and ſo more fit to be relyed on. In the next place, A Man ought, as much as poſſible, to contract Friendſhip with thoſe of equal Quality with himſelf. They who are Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour will be apt to Flatter, and they who are above will expect many times to be flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, at leaſt they will ſtand upon ſuch Punctilio's, and require that little De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and Condeſcenſion, as will hold ſome Reſemblance with State.</p>
               <p>Another Uſe a Man has of a Friend, is for Society, and for the Recreation of his Spirits. I know Solitude has ſometimes produc'd great Effects, but generally we find that Men, when they aree too much alone, their Spirits will either feed or prey upon themſelves, which turns to Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, and makes Nature Degenerate, or elſe they will ſeek to eaſe themſelves of the Burthen of their Thoughts, to ſuch mean and deſpicable Perſons, as ſhall occurr to them in the ordinary Courſe and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of their Lives, which muſt needs turn to the Detriment of Reputation. And becauſe the Thread of Talk is apt to draw out all the little Paſſages and Follies of a Man's Life, no Man in Diſcretion ought
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:100787:134"/>
to make another his Companion, of whoſe Secrecy he has not a good Aſſurance. Suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of Humour and Diſpoſition ſeems eſſentially requiſite to Cement Affections: Melancholy Men are many times Suſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and not over Complaiſant: They who are Gay and Airy, are apt to Ridicule the moſt Serious Occurrenees, and have little Compaſſion for anothers Misfortunes. Cholerick Men are apt to be Injurious, and in their Heats, will not only be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful, but are apt to Reveal the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of their Friends. Talkative Perſons, out of an Itch of Vanity, will be telling all and more than they know, both of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and others. He therefore who is of a Mixt and Even Temper, is really the beſt, being ſuch a one as can relieve the Oppreſs'd Spirits of another by his own Alacrity, or elſe partake of his Burthen by Condolence, and ſo accommodate himſelf to the others Condition in all its Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. If they be of ſuch a Profeſſion, by which one may help another, or if they incline to the ſame Studies, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the ſame Divertiſements and Sports, this alſo muſt needs give them an eaſier Paſſage into one another's Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and make their Converſation more durable; but in caſe they be ſeparated by particular Offices, Correſpondence by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:100787:135"/>
is a moſt Effectual Means, not only to Preſerve, but to Improve their Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>The laſt grand Uſe of a Friend, is to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite Buſineſs. A Man many times ſhall be reduc'd to ſuch Circumſtances, as 'twill be inconſiſtent with Diſcretion and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, to act Openly in his own Concerns; eſpecially in ſuch Caſes, as do depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Character of a Man's Perſonal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Qualities; as alſo where Baſhful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and want of Experience, may betray him to Abſurdities. I know a Man may meet with thoſe, who will be ready to do all Friendly Offices, but for the moſt part they are like <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Friends in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of the <hi>Lark,</hi> who never thought her Young Ones in Danger to be deſtroy'd, whil'ſt the Husbandman depended on his Friends and Kindred, to cut the Field of Corn in which ſhe had made her Neſt, but when ſhe heard that Husbandman, upon the Diſappointment he met with from his Friends and Kindred, was reſolv'd to do the Work himſelf, ſhe thought it then high time to provide againſt the Danger, and be gone Of all the Tempers and Diſpoſitions of Men, there is none more Inconſiſtent with the true End of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, than that of one who is pron'd and addicted to his Pleaſure: For altho ſuch a
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:100787:135"/>
Man, in the Heat of Wine or of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, or upon the Proſpect he has of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's being Serviceable to his Ends, may make Proteſtations of Kindneſs, yet be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd almoſt, he will deceive thee, when thou ſhalt moſt depend upon his Intereſt and Activity. For Men of this Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, making their own Eaſe and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to be the Level of all the Meaſures of Life, let a Friend but Importune them in a thing which ſhall give them a little Trouble, and they ſhall preſently look Coy, ſpeak Coldly, and ſhall find Excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to diſengage themſelves; but if Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted preſſingly, they will not ſtick to Reject their Friend for an Importunate and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Fellow; but if he be reduc'd to any Degree of Poverty and Want, 'twill be a ſhame, they think, to own any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him. Whoſoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore falis into the Converſation of a Man of this Complexion, would do well to try his Metal betimes, by feigning ſome Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of uſing his intereſt, that ſo he may know what Streſs to put upon him, in a Caſe of real Exigence. But let ſuch Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percilious and Sordid Spirits know, That he who is not a true Friend himſelf, will never find one of another, for let a Man's Natural Parts be never ſo Great, or his Fortune what it will be, he will find that
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:100787:136"/>
he is not always able to ſtand alone, and when ſuch a one ſhall require another's Help, perhaps of his Abuſed Friend, he may expect a Grimace, or ſome Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and Diſdainful thing from him, whom he never faithfully oblig'd.</p>
               <p>For the Generality of our Friends, they are full only of little Complements and Ceremonies, and are indeed to be treated much after the ſame Rate, with a few Cringes, and Impertinent Repititions of, <hi>Tour Humble Servant Sir,</hi> and now and then with ſome ſmall Scraps of News; but for the Uſe a Man may have of them, 'tis but like that of a Campagne-Coat, to be put off or on for the preſent Occaſion: They will ſerve for an hour or two to keep him Warm, but to have them always hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at one's Back, or about one, would be an intollerable Incumbrance. No, no, a true Friend, like my Shirt, is to be worn always next my Boſom, and ſerve to cover my Nakedneſs, with this only difference, That it ought never to be c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ang'd. To him it is that I have Recourſe in the hour of Trouble, and to him I poure out my Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Here then is that ſweet Fruit of Friendſhip: if my Condition be bad, the Evil becomes leſs by having a Partner; if good becomes greater by being commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated. If my Friend be well, I am better
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:100787:136"/>
from the Joy and Content I find in his Welfare, if he be ill, tho his Condition may create a Trouble, yet 'twill be a Comfort to me if I can relieve him; if not, 'tis ſome eaſe to me to condole with him: For really 'tis greater Pleaſure to ſuffer with a Friend one dearly loves, than to enjoy moſt things without him. When I am wearied out with Buſineſs, or (what's more tireſome) perhaps with Idleneſs, I go to my Friend, my faithful Companion, and with him I refreſh my Spirits, and we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to divert each other with all inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Converſe; and altho the Abſence of Friends doth many times miniſter cauſe of Anxiety and Troble, yet the hopes I have of ſeeing him, or of hearing good News from him, does ſeem to promiſe me ſome future Content I have not yet attain'd to, and ſo I am in a ſtate and condition which will be changing for the better: In fine, if I have any Suit depending, I acquaint my Friend with it, I boldly crave his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and perhaps his Aſſiſtance, he frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tells me of my Errors, not in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful way, but with that Tenderneſs and Affection, as proves ſufficiently his Sincerity and his Readineſs to help me.</p>
               <p>And here it is that the Condition of Subjects, is much happier than that of Princes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For firſt, Kings cannot contract
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:100787:137"/>
a true Friendſhip with their Equals. Policy and State oblige them to keep at diſtance from one another, not ſuffering them ſo much as to make an Acquaintance, and if at any time they meet, it is with ſo much Precaution of Danger, with ſuch Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of State, with ſuch Punctilio's of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Precedence, with ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance of Retinue, with ſuch Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Jealouſy, and with ſo many Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and Formalities, as cannot chooſe but render ſuch Interviews very Uneaſie, Expenſive, and many times Miſchievous; and upon this account they happen but ſeldom, and are very ſhort. Nay, ſo far are Kings from communicating their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets to one another, which yet is the chiefeſt point of Friendſhip, that it is the greateſt part of their Policy to conceal them, and therefore they are forc'd to have ſecret Spies upon one anothers Counſels, even then when they ſeem to be in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Concord, ſo that all the Endeavours of Friendſhip are ſacrific'd to Pretenſions of State, and even theſe Alliances hold no longer than Intereſt will give Leave. Nay, though they endeavour to ſtrengthen them by Oaths, or, what's more durable, by Matrimonial Vows, all's of little Force; for upon the firſt ſmall Exigence, or Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of State, it is all diſſolv'd, ſo that,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:100787:137"/>
as they are ſolemniz'd for the moſt part, by the Proxy of a naked Sword, ſo War ſeems to be the ſureſt Iſſue of ſuch Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. This we ſee in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> which notwithſtanding their near Mixture of Blood and their conſtant Intercourſe of Marriages, are in perpetual Hoſtility, which probably will never have an End, but in the Ruine of one of theſe two Monarchies. And as Princes cannot make a true Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with their Equals, ſo neither can they always do it ſafely with their Inferiours, for in the firſt place, Over great Familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Friendſhip betwixt Princes and Subjects, may be dangerous to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects themſelves. Extraordinary Favours are ever the Objects of Popular Envy. The Miſcarriages of Government, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Real or Imaginary, will be charg'd upon them, and ſometimes they are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up to appeaſe the People, tho in Effect, the Removal of one great Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, does but make way for another to run the ſame Deſtiny. Hence it is, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny give Ambiguous Advice, and ſtudy ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to accommodate themſelves to the Genius of a Prince by Compliance and Flatteries, than to their real Service by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepid Reſolutions, and by faithful and ſteddy Counſels: For where Effects will many times judge of Counſels, and ſince

the beſt deſigns may ſometimes find a contrary Effect, all men will not venture their preſent Fortunes upen ſo Hazardous an Iſſue. In the next place, over great Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity betwixt Princes and Subjects, hath prov'd ſometimes diſadvantagious to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces themſelves, tho certainly there are none who ſtand more in need of Friends, and faithful ones too, than Princes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we conſider the vaſt number and weight of Affairs which lies upon them, and of which they can have no Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation but from others, or whether we conſider the real Danger which attends them, either from Faction and ſecret Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies, or from Senſual Temptations and Pernicious Flatteries: And if it be their Misfortunes ſometimes to be abus'd by their Confidents, 'tis their Happineſs at other times, to receive Faithful and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Service from them, ſo that upon the whole, they are ſuch Inſtruments, without which Government cannot long ſubſiſt, nor a Prince long enjoy his own Repoſe.</p>
               <p>There is nothing more odious, than to ſtand oblig'd to ſome men, who preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming upon the Performance of ſome good Offices, take the Liberty to do ill ones, which is all one, as if a Man ſhould put forth his hand to ſave me from Falling, and at ano<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:100787:138"/>
trip up my Heels: where a man therefore does receive an Obligation, he ought to ſtudy a convenient time to make requital, not too ſuddenly, leſt he ſeem to throw back his Kindneſs at him; nor yet ought he to deferr it too long, leſt he be thought to be Forgetful or Ungrateful. Moreover, in ways of Friendſhip it has been ever held Prudence, for a Man not to be over-forwards to Oblige, or to make Shew of his Affection by Promiſes, leſt failing, he be thought to want either Power or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty to make good his Undertaking. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, men of this Temper, being apt to engage their Intereſt to many, are always under a Neceſſity of diſappointing ſome, and theſe will certainly be more diſguſted, when they find themſelves deceiv'd, then others can be pleas'd by any Kindneſs that ſhall be conferr'd upon them.</p>
               <p>There is no Enmity ſo Irreconcileable as that betwixt Perſons who were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the greateſt Friends. 'Tis not with them as with broken Bones, which are many times ſtronger by being ſet again; but 'tis like a Rupture in the Heart, where there is no Balſam ſufficient to cure the Wounds. To prevent therefore ſo fatal a Solution, 'twill not be amiſs to propoſe ſome Rules, of which the firſt is this: To emulate thy Friend in Kindneſs, and ſtudy
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:100787:139"/>
to do the ſame things to him, as thou would'ſt he ſhould do to thee; as for Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Complements, Fond Embraces, and Modiſh Forms, they are not to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd amongſt Friends, they are Childiſh and Effeminate, but let a Man endeavour to demonſtrate the Truth of his Heart, by the Reality of his Actions. The next Rule is this, For a Man not to flatter his Friend to his Face, but to make him Senſible, that in his Abſence, he has a tender Reguard for his Concerns and Reputation. Thirdly, Not to believe every ill Report of him, whether it relate to himſelf or others; and in caſe he give a Provocation, not to reply in Heat, but upon cool Blood, to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it amount to a real Injury, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will come to himſelf again, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the Offence; or whether a Man's ſelf did not give the firſt Occaſion. But in caſe the Stabbing Blow be once gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, I hold it almoſt Superfluous ever to attempt a Reconcilement: For where men have been Privy to one anothers Concerns, there will ſtill be ſome little Treachery on one ſide or the other, and this is a Point ſo Delicate and Tender, as ſurpaſſes all other Injuries. 'Tis the beſt way therefore in ſuch caſes to Unſaw Friendſhip, and not to tear it aſſunder. The injur'd Party may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from the other by little and little,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:100787:139"/>
but he may never rip up his Failings: For ſuch a one will never find a Friend. A Wound may be bound up, <hi>And after Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling there may be a Reconciliation,</hi> ſays the Wiſe man, <hi>but he that bewrayeth Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets is without Hope:</hi> Nay, tho he ſhould not fall to this Degree of Baſeneſs, yet where there has been a Truſt committed, one will live in perpetual Jealouſie and Diſtruſt of the other, as having the Means always in his Hands to do him Miſchief, which cannot but create a ſecret Fear, and conſequently a Hatred.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXVII. <hi>Of Reputation and Fame.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AMongſt the Bleſſings of Fortune, ſome are in our own Poſſeſſion, as Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Honour, Birth, and Riches, ſome are in the Poſſeſſion of others, and amongſt theſe we may reckon Reputation and Fame. Now altho' the former ſort of Goods ſeem more deſirable, being ſuch of which we may promiſe to our ſelves a more laſting Security, nevertheleſs the later are of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Importance, as being the very Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Civil Actions, and Glorious Undertakings. Reputation is a Jewel high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be valued, being got with Difficulty, loſt Eaſily, and being once Loſt, is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or never to be Retriev'd. It is the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which the World has of a Man's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Virtue: Like Letters of Credit, it procures a Man Reſpect wherever he comes, and is ready every where to ſupply his Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. I know it is ſomething Slaviſh and Hazardous to depend upon the Breath
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:100787:140"/>
of others, for the Opinion of Men being many times grounded upon Prejudice and Partial Affection, Falſe Informations, and Vulgar Fame (all which are very Unequal and Fallacious Meaſures) it may fall out ſo, That one who is really Deſerving, may have the Misfortune to be Cried down, and to be Trampled in the duſt, whil'ſt ſome Inconſiderable, but Fortunate Fool, ſhall be ſaluted every where with a Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and Healthful Air. To this purpoſe 'tis not Impertinent to relate a Hiſtory, which Monſieur <hi>Facet</hi> tells us of a certain Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in <hi>France,</hi> who, tho he had as good a Genius for Poetry as any of his Time, could never gain any Credit upon that Account; at length to convince the World of the Unjuſtice done him, he made uſe of this Expedient. It happen'd that there was much Enquiry amongſt the <hi>Beaux Eſprits,</hi> after a piece of <hi>Malherbe,</hi> a certain Poet in Reputation amongſt thoſe of his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. The foreſaid Gentleman, having had the good Fortune to meet with this Work of <hi>Malherbe,</hi> he compoſes ſomething of his own in the ſame way, and in Imitation of his Argument, which he made publick to the World, avouching it to be the Work of that celebrated Author. The Criticks had no ſooner caſt their Eyes upon it, but they preſently ſeem'd raviſh'd with Joy, lifting
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:100787:141"/>
up their Hands and Eyes at every Verſe, making long Pauſes at every Stanza, and breaking forth ever and anon into Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Divine Spirit and Excellency of that Auth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r, and had much ado to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themſelves out of the Extaſie. After this, the foreſaid Gentleman ſhews theſe Criticks the True and Genuine Piece of <hi>Malherbe,</hi> pretending that it was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his own, which he compos'd in Imitation of him, as having Affinity with the ſame Argument. But ſee the Effects of Opinion and Prejudice<hi>!</hi> No ſooner had they taſted of three or four Verſes, but they preſently began to look Sowre, and Cavil at them. The Senſe, ſays one, is Low and Trivial, the Expreſſions, ſays another, are Flat and Ridiculous, the Words were Improper, hardly one of them good <hi>French,</hi> and moſt abſurdly miſplac'd, cries a third. After they had Anatomiz'd and Tortur'd half a dozen Verſes at this Unmerciful rate, they thought it but loſt Labour to proceed any further, and ſo threw down the Paper, deeming the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to have had the Style and Genius of a <hi>Switzer</hi> rather than of a <hi>Frenchman.</hi> In fine, when they once came to underſtand the true Authors both of one and of the other, they were not a little ſurpriz'd at their own Partial Judgment, and ever after
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:100787:141"/>
held the Gentleman in that degree of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, which was due to his Merit.</p>
               <p>Men acquire Reputation ſeveral ways: Firſt, Upon the account of their Natural Perfections, whether of Body or Mind. Next upon the account of the Moral Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; and laſtly, upon the account of their Civil Capacities, ſuch as Prudence in the Adminiſtration of Buſineſs, Juſtneſs in Commerce, Ability and Integrity in Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, in all which Faculties, there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd ſomething of Artifice and Addreſs. Some Men are very Lucky in vending their Counterfeit Ware, but when the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture is once diſcover'd, they are blaſted ever after, ſo that even their real Virtues will gain them but little Credit; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is no Man under Heaven more Ridiculous and Odious than a Hypocrite.</p>
               <p>Applauſe is a thing very near of Kin to Reputation, only 'tis of a Nature more Momentany, as requiring always freſh Supplies from new Actions. The ways of getting it are chiefly ſuch as theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Liberality, Affability, giving of Reſpect, Officiouſneſs, or a Promptneſs to Oblige. But the ſureſt way, is, To make a Shew of having a Publick Spirit, without the leaſt Biaſs of Self-Intereſt, and eſpecially by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking the Protection of an Inferiour againſt a Superiour; which Method is
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:100787:142"/>
ever more Plauſible and Winning, the Greater the Perſon is with whom we do contend, or the Greater the Party is which it does endeavour to Support: This is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Popularity, which when it looks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquint at Government, (as we may find perhaps in Modern Examples) 'tis of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Conſequence, for the greateſt Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors have been ever thoſe who have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to Cajole the ſimple Multitude, and to draw them on to act a part in their own Ambitious Deſigns, by pretending to eſpouſe their Grievances.</p>
               <p>There is a Sly ſort of way by which many labour to win Applauſe, that is, When they think they Deſerve well, they will be ſtill Diſcommending themſelves, and their Actions, to that Degree, as ſhall put a Force on others to commend them: For when a Man is ſo Copious in Undervaluing himſelf, and withall affects a kind of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty in Reporting his own Performances, no man can be ſo Rude and ill Bred, as not to help him at ſuch a Lift; but realy this way is ſo Common, Groſs and Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, as cannot chooſe but Nauſeate the Hearer, and render the Relation very Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent and Ridiculous. Some Men have a Knack of Commending others to their Faces, to the Intent they may repay them in the ſame Goyn, which is no other than
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:100787:142"/>
that Horſe-Civility of <hi>Nab me, and I'll nab thee.</hi> 'Tis ſomething more Artificial for a Man, To Commend that in another, in which he knows himſelf to be in ſome meaſure Eminent; tho really a Man ſpeaks his Merit beſt by Silence, unleſs it be in ſuch Caſes where the Truth of his Actions is Queſtion'd or Defam'd, for here a Man may openly aſſert his own Merit, where Silence would be accounted Cowardize and a Confeſſion of Guilt.</p>
               <p>Reputation is a Purchaſe which every Man ought by all fair Means to Perſerve, not only for the Credit and Luſtre it gives to all the Actions of his Life, but for the great Difficulties of Recovering it again when once 'tis Loſt. If this happen through a Man's Miſdemeanour, 'twill be a long time before he recover his former Station, nor will this be brought about too, but by many Proofs of a real Amendment. If it happen through another Default, as by Slander and Defamation, I know not how the Detractor can fairly make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for ſuch an Injury: For tho an Honeſt Man's Credit will not eaſily be blaſted amongſt thoſe who know him, yet a Falſe Report being once let looſe into the open Air, it flies every where, and is in an hundred Places at once, where the Injur'd Party is not known, and where 'tis
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:100787:143"/>
Impoſſible he ſhould be Preſent to make his own Defence, or ſuppoſe the Slanderer ſhould have ſo much Conſcience as to Confeſs his own Guilt (which rarely or never happens) yet 'tis a thouſand to one if ſuch a Confeſſion does ever arrive to the ſame Perſons, who are prepoſſeſs'd with former Reports. Beſides, the Majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Men being Malicious, and Prone to Believe, or, for Talks-ſake, to Speak all the ill things they hear of others, I conceive it almoſt Impoſſible, to make an Adequate Satisfaction for ſuch an Injury, by Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the Blots of a Defamation which is Artificially manag'd, and with a Shew of Probability. I know not whether <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavel</hi>'s Rule holds always, which is, <hi>To throw Dirt enough, and be ſure ſome will ſtick:</hi> I rather incline to the Opinion of <hi>Favorinus; That Strong and Violent Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies are not the moſt Injurious:</hi> Becauſe Men of Judgement will conclude that they proceed from Malice, and to give little Credit to them, whereas he who faintly Commends another, is many times more Miſchievous, for he ſeems to poſſeſs Men with an Opinion that he is his Friend, from whence they will conclude, that 'tis want of Merit that ſets him at ſo low a rate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:100787:143"/>
Our Laws, Methinks, ſeem a little too Remiſs againſt Defamations. 'Tis true, the Peerage is well ſecur'd, or perhaps they are a little too Rigorous on their Behalf; but for the Gentry, who are many times Equal to Peers, both as to Family and Fortune, they may not hope for any ſuch ſuitable Reparation; but in this Caſe they are Levell'd with the Meaneſt of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nay, in ſome Senſe they are Worſe: For Injuries of this Nature, if they be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to a Gentleman, are meaſur'd by a Verdict of Twelve Men, who being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Clowns, or mean Yeomen, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Averſion or Hatred for the Gentry, are very Incompetent Judges of Honour. 'Tis not every Opprobrious Word which ought to be brought before a Tribunal, this would be Trivial and Endleſs, but certainly, there may be ſome Slanders ſo contriv'd, and of that rank Malice, as may prove as Injurious as Death it ſelf, and for which, a Man might expect from ſome Juries, ſuch a Conſideration of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, as would expoſe the Complainant but to further Contempt and Scorn; whereas he who does but Forty Shillings Injury in Stealing of a Beaſt, ſhall loſe his Life. I do not juſtifie the Uſe of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, but this ſeems Conſonant to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Reaſon, that when the Laws of a
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:100787:144"/>
Countrey do not give a Man Relief, by the Law of Nature he may relieve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſo that in ſome Circumſtances, if the loſs of Reputation be Equal to that of our deareſt Enjoyments, and if Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be ruin'd by Lies, as well as by real Miſdemeanours, I think they are not to be look'd upon as the moſt Guilty of Criminals, who endeavour to vindicate an Injur'd Innocence with their Lives: To prevent all which Miſchiefs, there cannot be a better Expedient, than the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a <hi>Court of Honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for Fame it is of two Sorts. Firſt, That which is Vulgarly ſo called, which is the ſame with common Rumour or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port: This kind of Fame is Inconſiderable and Baſe, and with good Reaſon is called <hi>Mendax,</hi> hence all Scandalous and Defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory Libels are called <hi>Famoſi.</hi> But there is another Sort of Fame, of a far different Nature, being the Product of an Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Merit, confirm'd by the Suffrages of Mankind, and by the concurring Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Time.</p>
               <p>Fame and Reputation differ very much, Firſt in reſpect of the Subject: Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may belong to Private Perſons of Mean and Common Merit; but Fame belongs to thoſe of a greater Genius, ſuch as in Ancient Times were call'd <hi>Hero's:</hi> Next
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:100787:144"/>
they differ in reſpect of Extent, the Sphere of Reputation is properly circumſcrib'd within the narrow Territories of a Man's own Acquaintance, but Fame reigns where a Man never was, nor never can be. In the laſt place, they differ in reſpect of Durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Reputation properly belongs to the Living, for it is nothing but the Credit which a Man gains in the Opinion of men, by his Actions and Conduct, ſo that we cannot ſay with any Congruity, that <hi>Achilles, Alexander,</hi> or <hi>Phidias</hi> are now in Reputation, but we may ſay that they are at this day Famous: For Fame is not ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated with Life, but does rather Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence after Death, and ſo by a continual Propagation through all the Succeſſion of Ages, <hi>Creſcit Eundo,</hi> it grows greater by the Progreſs, not only in Degree, but in Dimenſion: So that I doubt not, but that the Fame of <hi>Homer</hi> is now much greater, than when the ſeven Towns contended for his Birth, I ſay greater, not only in the Opinion of men, but in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality and Extent: For what was then ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated in the narrow Cantons of <hi>Greece,</hi> is now diffus'd through the vaſter Circles of the Univerſe; and ſo we may ſay of the reſt of the Ancient Worthies, whoſe Fame will be Celebrated to the laſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Time. We cannot blame Men
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:100787:145"/>
therefore, if they be more than ordinary deſirous, to purchaſe this Treaſure, which will not only Embalme their Memories, and make them Fragrant, but alſo render them Immortal.</p>
               <p>Fame ſeems to marſhal Men in this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. In the firſt place are Law-givers; ſuch as <hi>Numa, Solon,</hi> and <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe reduce Mankind into Civil Society, and leave them thoſe Maxims by which Kingdoms grow and flouriſh. In the next place, are the Founders of Nations, ſuch as <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Romulus:</hi> theſe I place after the other, the later ſeeming only to make the Body, but the former give the Soul to Government: For Kingdoms once foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if they be not preſerv'd by found Laws, will quickly run to Ruine. In the third place, are the Preſervers of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths, and theſe are of two Sorts: Firſt, ſuch as by Military Proweſs deliver their Countrey from Invaſion and Ruine, and of this kind were <hi>Themiſtocles, Scipio,</hi> and ſome others of old: Or ſecondly, they are ſuch, who by their Vigilance and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, preſerve the State from Civil Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and Conſpiracies, and ſuch a one was <hi>Cicero.</hi> As for thoſe who fight for the Enlargement of Empire and Glory, tho they pretend to make Fame the Motive, they have really the leaſt Title to it of
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:100787:145"/>
any, unleſs it be in the ſame Senſe as <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſtratus</hi> had, who, to get himſelf a Name, burnt the <hi>Epheſian</hi> Temple, with this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Addition only to the Impiety, that they make all Mankind the Sacrifice: For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Waſt and Deſolation of Places not only Profane but Sacred, they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Satiated with Humane Blood, and all to get the Stile of Glorious; whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Beſt of them, come ſhort of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Bruits, in a true Generous and Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Valour: And if fighting an Equal or a Stronger Enemy, be a thing which may deſerve an Altar, I know not but Cocks and Dogs may, after the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Rites, be Deified, ſince they far Exceed the proudeſt Hero's in Bravery and Courage. They who challenge the next Rank in the Court of Fame, are the Founders and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorers of ſeveral Sciences, and of other Profeſſions Beneficial to Mankind, as <hi>Galen,</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> for Phyſick; <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian</hi> for the Laws, <hi>Euclid, Archimedes, Proclus, &amp;c.</hi> for the Mathematicks; <hi>Socrates, Plato, Zeno, Epicurus,</hi> and others for Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; with Infinite more of later Date. As for <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> his Genius would have ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted well with the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Government, ſince he endeavour'd to acquire Empire in Learning, by Strangling his Brethren. To theſe I might add the Patrons of Learning,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:100787:146"/>
but that their Quality and other Merits, place them, many times, in a higher De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Fame: For ſuch a one was <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus Ceſar</hi> of old, and King <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt is Celebrated amongſt the Princes of this later Age, for a great Cheriſher of Learning and Learned Men. Nor may we ommit to mention the Founders of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and Hoſpitals, and of other Publick Works, whether of Charity, or of Civil Benefit. The laſt Order of Men who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a Place in the Regiſter of Fame, are the Inventers of Arts, as of Navigation, Painting, Sculpture, Printing, with Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite other Mechanical, Natural, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Diſcoveries, and here I know not, whether that Society lately Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>England,</hi> might not be Intitled to further Honour, beſides that of being ſtiled the Royal, were the firſt Deſign of that Company duly follow'd and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe who endeavour'd to make their Names Perpetual, by Stupendious and Expenſive Works, as by Pyramids, Obelisks, the Coloſſus of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> with many ſuch like Prodigious and Vain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, tho' they might give occaſion for their Names to be remembred in after Ages, they had no juſt Pretenſions to Fame, The Emperours <hi>Trajan</hi> and <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus,</hi>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:100787:146"/>
did really Acquire and Transfer greater Glory to Poſterity, by the Stiles of <hi>Optimus</hi> and <hi>Pius,</hi> than by their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns at this day extant, tho beautified with their Trophies, and other Figures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting their Heroick Actions. A Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar or Temple, tho of Marble, cannot be ſo Poliſh'd, nor ſo Solid and Durable a Monument, as a Publick Work, which ſhall render after-Generations Happy; ſo that the Univerſality of the Benefit, is that which gives Life, Amplitude, and Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity to Fame. Oſtentation and Vain Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry are falſe Colours of Fame, and under this Head we may reduce thoſe, who hope to get a Name by Pompous Shews, Rich Furniture, Splendid Retinues, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe Entertainments, all which, when they exceed their due Circumſtances, do indeed make the Actions talkt of, but 'tis in ſuch a way, as 'twere much better to be ever in Obſcurity: For ſuch generally are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd by Wiſe men, Flatter'd by Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, Cheated by Knaves, and are the Companions of Fools.</p>
               <p>There are ſome who Acquire Fame, by endeavouring to Shun it, as tho like a Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, 'twould fly from thoſe who follow it, but follow thoſe who fly it. Of this Nature we have many Examples, amongſt Religious Perſons of the Primitive Times:
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:100787:147"/>
We may judge the Beſt of them, and that their Behaviour proceeded from Chriſtian Modeſty, tho otherwiſe we find them to be many times Men, that is, Subject to Ambition and Paſſions as well as others. Alſo amongſt the Philoſophers, we may meet with ſome few, who, like <hi>Diogenes,</hi> became Illuſtrious by affecting Obſcurity. However, 'tis certain that the moſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and Ambitious of Perſons, do moſt times make the greateſt Shew of Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. There is one who may make Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of being <hi>Servus Servorum,</hi> who in Reality, declares himſelf to be <hi>Dominus Dominorum;</hi> ſo that the Lower the Shaft is drawn, the Higher is the Flight deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. This Method, whether it proceed from Hypocriſy, or from a real Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of Self-Inſufficiency, 'tis certain that it makes after-Fame more Great; for moſt men will attribute the Change to Merit. Things which ſeem to riſe above the Level of their Natures, carry with them ſome Shew of Miracles, which will be ſure to create Admiration, which is the Mother of Fame.

               <head>CHAP. XXVIII. <hi>Of Converſation.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HAving, in the foregoing Chapters, conſider'd this Great and Beautiful Creature Man, in all the Organs and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Body and Mind, let us now take a general Survey of him as one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate and Entire Piece, and as he ſtands expos'd to View, in the ſeveral Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures and Circumſtances of Life. He who would judge aright of a curious Statue, conſiders firſt, With what Exactneſs eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Member is fram'd and poliſh'd, then he conſiders the Air and Symmetry of the Whole, and the Correſpondence of the Parts to one another. He takes his ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Stands, and when he has ſurrounded the Figure, and ſeen it well in all its Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and Side-views, and finds all to be Uniform and Natural, then is he raviſh'd with a real Pleaſure in Contemplating the Genius and Ingenuity of the Artiſt. Firſt then, we will view Man in the ſeveral Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures that he makes, when he ſtands in
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:100787:148"/>
Concert with others of his own Nature, and when he ſtands Solitary and alone. Whether it be a Defect, or a Perfection of Man's Nature, to be obnoxious to Change, is not worth our Diſpute; 'tis ſufficient for our preſent Purpoſe, to conſider that God who hath made all things in the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt manner, has made them ſubject to Viciſſitude, and contrary Diſpoſitions. Thus Summer and Winter, Day and Night, Labour and Reſt, Repletion and Want, with all the Alterations of Life, does not only ſerve to Embeliſh Nature in General, by a grateful Variety, but they are uſeful alſo in the Senſe and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh which they give to one another. For our Purpoſe, Man, tho he be intended by Nature for a Sociable Creature, and be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of great Improvement and Pleaſure, by Converſe, yet were he oblig'd always to be in Company, his Spirits would ſoon be Exhauſted. And on the other hand, tho Solitude be very Beneficial, by giving him Leiſure to recollect his Thoughts and Spirits, and to review his Actions in Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, yet he nevertheleſs, who is reduc'd to a perpetual Retreat, except he be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with Extraordinary Abilities of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Mind, will, for want of new Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to imploy his Thoughts, find himſelf aſſaulted with Legions of his own Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſms,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:100787:148"/>
all which will create in him greater Diſtraction, than the confus'd Noiſe of an Impertinent and Importunate Crowd.</p>
               <p>As to the Subjeſt which is before us, in this, as in many other Caſes of Life, the Opinion and Practice of the Majority ought by no means to give the Rule, and to paſs for the Suffrage of Reaſon. By go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Company men generally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand nothing elſe, but going to the Ale-houſe, or in the Gentiler Phraſe, the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern. I know that the Generality of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is of another Sentiment: This Vice is only National, and being ſo of Courſe, it requires a Commentary in an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Stile. And becauſe, Gentlemen of this Denomination, would be thought to be Merry, I will be men I with them for once. Let us ſuppoſe then a Club of Honeſt Fellows, to meet together in ſome ſuch place of Reputation for good Liquor: After a familiar Hug or two, down they ſit, and, with wonderful Civility, they drink one another's Healths, and the Healths of their Miſtreſſes: From thence they paſs to His <hi>Majestie</hi>'s, and think they act the Part of Loyal Subjects, by prefixing his Name to a Debauch, many of which could as well part with their Blood, as pay their Proportion in a Subſidy, when it is really for His <hi>Majestie</hi>'s and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion's
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:100787:149"/>
Safety, tho perhaps the Summ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd of them does not amount to one ſingle Share in a Reckoning. After His Majeſtie's Health, 'tis fit we ſhould drink the Health of our Friends, for Example, of the L. Lieutenant of the County, and of ſome of his Deputy Lieutenants: This Knight, that Eſquire, that honeſt Fellow muſt not be forgotten, tho he be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to me by any Obligation, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably as very a Sot as any in the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. No ſooner has one perform'd his part with a good Grace, but another ſucceeds, and does Right to the Friends and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of the firſt; then a Third and a Fourth come on: By this time they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be Mellow, and to Conteſt; this man has not ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> it, that man's Glaſs was not full, and to make up the Harmony, one ſings a drunken Song, a ſecond Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, another talks Obſcenely, a fourth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be Abuſive. This man ſwears Oaths of a deeper Tincture, than that of the Wine he drinks; that Man pretends to be a Wit, and ſpouts Poetry by Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm; another goes a ſtrain higher, and ſpits Atheiſm and Blaſphemy. Here one Lyes more Profoundly than he Drinks, Bragging of the Quarrels he has had with Men, and of the Favours with Women: There another does nothing but Curſe and
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:100787:149"/>
Damn the Drawer, for bringing up bad Wine. Here is a Politician, who is for ſecuring the King's Perſon againſt Treaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Plots, in the Senſe as a Man would ſecure the Perſon of his Enemy, by Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him, and by depriving him of all Means and Liberty to Act; another is for Setling Religion, for Purging the Clergy, and Rooting out of Popery. And amongſt ſuch a Medly of Humours, 'tis much if there be not one who would be thought a down-right Honeſt Fellow, by diſcovering what he knows of his Friend's Concerns, and of his own; and to let you ſee, he ſhows you all that is within him, he Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits out whatſoever is lodg'd in his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, and in his Breaſt too, which proves many times the more Loathſome of the two, I mean his Unclean Thoughts; to all which let us add the Smoak and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, the Confuſion of Tongues, the Clat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of Pots, and the Knocking for Drawers, with many other Diſorders, of which any one would be ſufficient to break the Brains of any Sober perſon. In fine, after five or ſix Hours ſweet Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this way, the Company begins to Riſe up, or rather to Fall down one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, and in the midſt of Stink, Darkneſs and Confuſion, every one Stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers his ſeveral way, and by the help of
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:100787:150"/>
Servants are laid to Kennel, where for the reſt, 'tis fit only to be known by a Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger. 'Tis true, all good Fellows do not make Merry to this Depth of Beſtiality, tho 'tis ſeldom, but they arrive to ſome Degree or other of it; and he who comes off beſt, will have but too much Reaſon, I fear, to lament his Loſs: For admitting ſuch a Converſation ſhall become Habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, as it ſeldom falls out otherwiſe, they will in Time be Senſible of a Notable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, Firſt, in their Natural Parts, Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in their Reputation, in the next place in their Health, and laſtly in their Eſtates, which are the four great Bleſſings ſo Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to man's Felicity, that the Loſs of any one of them is ſufficient to make him Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. And 'tis certainly but a Sad thing, when a man, upon the Cloſe of his Days, in ſtead of looking backwards upon the Virtuous Actions of his paſt Life, and forwards upon the Rewards which do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them in a Future, ſhall have nothing to entertain his Thoughts with, but his paſt Surfeits, his preſent Pains, and his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Miſery; or if there be any Spark of Senſe or Reaſon yet Unquench'd, 'twill ſerve only to diſcover to him his Irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Loſs, and to make his Condition more Sad and Deplorable. I have known many, who, whilſt they have enjoy'd all
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:100787:150"/>
the Advantages of a Vigorous Youth, and of an Ingenious Education, whilſt they have lain in the Boſom of Arts and Literature and have had all the Encouragements of preſent Maintenance, and of future Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, notwithſtanding all theſe, have ſtifled all their Natural Endowments, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their preſent Enjoyments, as alſo all the Hopes of a Future and Solid Happineſs, inſomuch that at the Age of Thirty, when a man Naturally is in his greateſt Strength and Beauty, when his Parts are moſt Florid, his Spirits in the higheſt Circulation, and all the Faculties of Body and Mind, are in their full Flower and Luſtre, then I ſay, they have with great Expenſe and Pain, arriv'd, if it be not Improper to ſay ſo, to the loweſt Sink of Sottiſhneſs and Stupidity.</p>
               <p>I am not of ſo Moroſe Principles, as ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to baniſh all good Fellowſhip in this kind: The many Occaſions of Life, and the frequent Rencounter of Friends, do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite, if not force Men, ſometimes to take this Liberty. That which is juſtly Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able is Frequency, and above all, that Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Ceremony of drinking Healths, with Provocations to others to do the ſame, tho their Conſtitutions of Body be never ſo Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant. I know the drinking of Healths is a Cuſtom, in its own Nature, Inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:100787:151"/>
and Indifferent: For me to Drink, is an Act of Nature, and to Remember my Friend, is an Act of Moral Virtue, now in Drinking of a Health, theſe two are joyn'd in one. Notwithſtanding 'tis a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rule in all things of this Nature, That where the doing of an Act, can produce little or no Good, but is probable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce much Evil, 'tis Safeſt to omit it, and of this kind is the Drinking of Healths without diſpute as being the Cement of Drunkenneſs, and conſequently the Source of all thoſe Fatal Miſchiefs, and of that Beaſtlineſs which attend it. And to ſhew the Abſurdity of this Ceremony, I would gladly know, Why we may not as well Eat as Drink one anothers Healths, ſince Eating contributes as much to Life and Health as Drinking; and why all Perſons maugre the Reluctancy of their Appetite, and the Weakneſs of their Conſtitutions, ſhould not be forc'd to Eat ſo many Slices of Powder'd Beef, to the Good-health and Proſperity of ſo many Ladies and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as a Trencher-Champion ſhall be pleas'd to name. Nay further; Exerciſe, no doubt, contributes to Health as well as Drinking, ſuch as Riding for the Purpoſe, which is not only terminated in the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Rider, but of another Perſon, to whom, I may be, and am oft-times Service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:100787:151"/>
by this Exerciſe, which I cannot be by Drinking. Let us ſuppoſe then a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Gentlemen, to meet together for their Recreation, would it not ſeem ſtrange and Extravagant, if theſe Gentlemen ſhould be oblig'd to Ride one anothers Healths, and the Healths of their Miſtreſſes; and that tho one be Corpulent, another Gouty, a third Aged, yet maugre all Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, every one muſt Mount and Ride at the ſame Tantarrah, tho it were down a Precipice, to ſhew their Courage? This Frolick of Riding would certainly ſeem ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Extravagant and Ridiculous, and yet 'tis leſs Extravagant than Drinking Healths to Exceſs, for in this Engagement, moſt, if not all, are certain to break their Brains, whereas in the other Exerciſe, ſome one or two only, is but in a Probability to break his Neck. Beſides, Eſtate, Credit, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Parts are not in ſo great Danger here, as under Drunkenneſs and Intemperance, nor is the Performance attended with ſo much Naſtineſs and Brutality, as in the other Engagement, and may therefore paſs for the more Rational Divertiſement.</p>
               <p>'Twere much to be wiſh'd, That as we follow the Vices, ſo alſo that we would imitate the Virtues of other Nations in this Particular, of thoſe, I mean, who are bleſs'd with the Warmer Influence of the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:100787:152"/>
Sun: They never reſort to theſe Common Houſes, but as they do to other Common Houſes, into which all enter in caſe of Neceſſity, and then away; but in ſtead of Drinking-Clubbs, they have Academies, either for Muſick, for Refining their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, for Exerciſes of Oratory, or for Conferences about the Improvements of Art and Nature. Indeed our <hi>Royal Society</hi> was a Noble Inſtitution, and is better eſteem'd of by Forreigners, than by the Generality of our Natives. 'Tis Pity but it had a due Encouragement, and were propagated with a Succeſſion of Inquiſitive and Ingenious Perſons, and by a daily Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of new Diſcoveries. 'Twere to be wiſh'd alſo, That ſome ſuch like Societies as thoſe above mention'd, were encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd in other Cities of this Kingdom. They have alſo in <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, Religious Companies and Sodalities, ſome of which are very Uſeful and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to the Publick. The like alſo might be Countenanc'd in <hi>England,</hi> without Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Popery, and would be found to be leſs Deſtructive to Government, Religion and Property, than many of our Factions Coffee-Houſes, or thoſe Secret Aſſemblies and Fraternities of Fanatick Clowns; and ſo I have done making Merry with my Good-fellows, and ſhall return to my ſerious way again.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:100787:152"/>
Whoſoever aſſociates himſelf with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a way of Familiarity and Converſe, ought to propoſe one or both of theſe two Ends, <hi>viz.</hi> Either to Communicate or to Receive Benefit, which may be as well by Improving our Knowledge, as by Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Spirits, over tir'd with Buſineſs, Labour and Study, in an Innocent Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Paſtime and Diſcourſe. And to this end, Every man ought to have a Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of thoſe Diſcontented and <hi>Saturnine</hi> Tempers, who are ever apt to interpret all things in the Worſt Senſe, and if any Miſcarriage happen to be diſcovered, in the Heat and Confidence of Converſation, they are not over Candid in their Comments, nor over Faithful in Concealing them, eſpecially if there be any thing of Intereſt which may tempt them to be Perſidious.</p>
               <p>Could a Man be exalted to that Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as at one View to Survey all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Humours, Paſſions, Deſigns and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in the Inhabitants but of one City on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 'twould appear doubtleſs to him, to be a greater <hi>Chaos,</hi> than that out of which Nature was at firſt form'd, and it would encreaſe his Pleaſure and Admiration, to conſider, That all theſe Creatures, acting by Different and Irreconcileable Principles, do notwithſtanding all pretend, or at leaſt ſhould pretend, to act in Conformity to
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:100787:153"/>
one ſtanding Principle of Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Humane Reaſon. Indeed nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Faculty Divinely aſſiſted, is able to look upon ſuch an Infinite Number of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions at once. However, 'tis not Difficult for an ordinary Capacity, ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to behold a great Number of them, by entring into the Company and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men. I ſhall not enter upon the detail by deſcanting upon the Humors of <hi>Rhodomants,</hi> of Foplings and the like, they are too Trivial and Ridiculous, in every place, as well as upon the Stage. I ſhall only give my Reader a Taſt in two Sorts of Men, which we meet with in all Company, and which are the Peſt of all Innocent Converſe. The firſt is the great and Impertinent Talker. He is nothing but Drum and Noiſe, like an Impudent Domeſtick Intelligence, he pretends to know all the Affairs of City and Country, and vents nothing but Impertinence and Lyes: He runs from one thing to another without any Coherence of Subject, Order of Words, and with great Precipitancy and Confuſion of Tongue. And if a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon offer to faſten on any looſe Thread of his Jargon, he replyes upon him, Pray Sir, hold give me Leave to ſpeak but a Word Sir, and I have done, and then runs he on at his former Carier of Non-ſence and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:100787:153"/>
and ſo <hi>toties quoties,</hi> till at length he has ſo ſtupifi'd and ſtunn'd his Hearers, with his continual Rattle and Tautology, that like men amaz'd, they know not what it was that began the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, nor what has been ſaid all the while, nor what to reply; and if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their Senſes a little, and enter upon a new Subject, this Drone with his Buzz puts them all to Silence, and then tames himſelf upon his Extraordinary Abilities in Diſcourſe. There is another Sort of Men yet more Troubleſome than the former, I mean the Opiniaſter, who to ſhew his Parts, upon every little Oppoſition will take up the Cudgels, and fall to Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and this too with ſo much Sweat and Reſolution, with ſuch Preambles and Hypotheſes, with ſuch Pompous Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and with ſuch a Supercilious and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſterial Meen, as tho an Article of Faith, or the higheſt Point of Intereſt and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour were brought upon the Tryal; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Subject perhaps is ſome poor Trivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al thing, as, Whether a Cloak or a Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne Coat be more Convenient, which puts me in mind of a great Diſpute rais'd in <hi>Holland,</hi> which was, Whether the Hook caught the Fiſh, or the Fiſh the Hook: Upon which Grand and Weighty Queſtion, the Company was divided, but
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:100787:154"/>
ſoon fell together again, I mean by the Ears, and in Concluſion the whole City took the Alarm, and many men loſt their Lives in the Tumult before the Knotty Point could be decided.</p>
               <p>Whoſoever would gain Applauſe in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, ought at leaſt to pretend to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, and to obſerve the ſeveral Critical Minutes of Speech: he ought to Introduce himſelf rather by Adding ſome new Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to confirm the Diſcourſe of him who ſpake laſt, and ſo Inſinuate into the good Opinion of his Hearer, than by a Dogmatick and Inſolent Contradiction, force the other to ſtand ſtiffly upon his Guard, and to give him a Defiance. If it happen at any time, that a man gain the Point upon another, he ought by all means to avoid Oſtentation, which looks like an Inſult. They who are the greateſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in this Art, will ſeem at leaſt to make ſome Ingenuous Submiſſion to him they engage with, or elſe with great Dexterity, divert the Diſcourſe to another Subject, which doth not only leave them in the good Opinion of him they do contend with, but acquires to them a general Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe and Eſteem of Courteſie. Let a Man's Natural or Acquir'd Parts be never ſo great, there are two ſorts of Perſons, with which a Man ought not to Conteſt,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:100787:154"/>
for the ſake of Argument: The firſt are thoſe who are much above us in Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Power; for beſides the Indecency of Preſsing upon our Betters, ſuch Perſons, when they find themſelves ſubdu'd by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Reaſon, will find a time to make him Senſible that they are above him at other Points, which may prove, if not more Acute, yet more Wounding than his Arguments. Another Sort of Men, with which we ought to avoid Contention, are ſuch as are much our Inferiours, for by Coping with them, a Man renders them Equal to himſelf, and in caſe he gets the Better, 'twill be no Credit, and in caſe he be Foyl'd, 'twill leave a Mark of Shame and Reproach upon him: So that here, as in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Caſes of Life, a Man ought not, in Prudence, to enter upon ſuch Actions, where the Miſcarriage will be far more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious and Detrimental, than the Succeſs can be Beneficial. 'Tis no ſmall piece of Art alſo, for a Man to make little or no Shew of that in which the World knows him to be Skilful: For by this means, his real Ignorance of many things, will be Conceal'd, whilſt men conclude, his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in them, to proceed from the ſame Stock of Reſervedneſs and Modeſty.</p>
               <p>The Knack of telling facetious Stories, if they be not often Repeated, and too
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:100787:155"/>
Romantick, is much more Taking in Company, than cloſe and preſſing Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings; for theſe ſeem to put the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence too much upon the Rack, and many times force them to rally all their Strength to make good the Counterpoint, which is a thing too Serious for a mixt Company, whereas the former Method leaves all men in a calm Repoſe, and by a Soft and Gentle Progreſs, gains upon the Hearers Fancy, and the pleaſant Repreſentation of Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges by Fables, or ſome Witty Emblems and Alluſions, will not fail to make a firm Impreſſion upon his Memory. There is another ſort of Entertainment, much us'd in better Company, which is Railery, being nothing but the ſudden Sallies of a pleaſant Wit Animadverting upon the little Faults and Paſſages of another, with ſome Tartneſs mix'd with Pleaſantneſs, being ſuch only as rubbs the Skin, and ſeems to quicken the Spirit of him who is the Subject of it, to make uſe of the ſame Weapons. He who uſes this Liberty, ought to be well acquainted, with the Perſons he ſports with, and to beware of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr; but above all not to make the great and notorious Miſcarriages of another, as alſo his Blemiſhes in Body or Reputation, to be the wanton Subject of his Wit, tho it be cloth'd in Senſe never ſo Ambiguous,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:100787:155"/>
and the Fancy be never ſo Pleaſant, leſt his own Defects be brought upon the Stage, in which caſe all the Spectators would be glad to ſee the firſt Aggreſſor put out of Countenance. 'Twas prudently done of <hi>Valerius,</hi> who being Crooked, and Splay-footed, would, by way of Preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſtill begin to Droll upon himſelf, and when he had ſaid all the Abuſive things to which ſuch a Deformed Body was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious, and had left nothing for another Wit to work upon, then would he begin to fall upon the Company, and make them the Subject of his Sport. Railery ſeldom goes beyond the third Repartie, without pricking to the Quick, and he who finds himſelf to be maſter'd at this Point, will eaſily be wrought upon to make his Repaſs, with ſomething that is more piercing than his Wit. Thoſe who are much addicted to Mirth and Railery, are Subject to one Inconvenience, <hi>viz.</hi> To have their Words doubtfully Interpreted: For ſpeaking always in the ſame Merry Air, we know not when they are Serious, which, in a further Progreſs, will beget a Habit of Artifice and Diſſimulation, a thing by no means to be practis'd amongſt Friends, as being of far leſs Repute, than a plain and frank Expreſſion. There is alſo a kind of groſs Railery, in uſe with
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:100787:156"/>
thoſe of a meaner Education, being nothing but a Ruſtick and Clowniſh Jeering, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compani'd with ſome Smutty Phraſes, and with Exceſſive Laughter: This for the moſt part proves no other but Abuſe, and is never pretended to by any Perſon of Breeding and Ingenuity.</p>
               <p>Ceremonies are to be avoided in Private and Familiar Society. Some little Forms of Complement are uſeful, to Uſher in Converſe, but whatſoever is Studied or Pointed, looks Pedantick, and would be as Comical and Ridiculous as to ſee a Man with a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tread, with a Paſte-board Collar, and ſtarcht Whiskers, to make his Entry, and after a profound Reverence, to Invite the Company to a Collation; or (to purſue the Metaphor) to ſee the ſame Collation Conſecrated by the long and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Ejaculations of a Groaning Brother. He alſo who enters into Company to Divert, and to be Diverted, ought not to have his Countenance embarraſs'd, and his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be read by every one in his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head: Such a one, like a piece of Leaven, will quickly make the whole Lump Sowre. A Frank and Chearful Air, without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a word, does, many times, diſpoſe the Company to Mirth and good Humour, tho, in Perſons who frequent the Court, ſomething more of Artifice is requiſite:
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:100787:156"/>
Such generally are Souple, and are always ready to accommodate themſelves to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Fancies, by ſome Formalities of an Obliging Stamp, and by performing little Offices of Kindneſs, and by promiſing Great ones. The Guard, which ſuch ought to keep always upon their Words and Actions, makes them generally Diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers, ſuch at leaſt as conceal their own Sentiments and Counſels, by a thouſand Diſguiſes, which is a thing in ſome meaſure Commendable in all Perſons, but is Eſſential to a Courtier, who alſo, by the humble Applications he daily makes to the great Favourites and Ladies, gets ſuch a Habit of Cringing and Cajolerie, that he cannot diveſt himſelf of ſuch Formalities, when he comes into the Campany of Inferiour Perſons.</p>

               <p>AS Multitude and Company contri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bute much to the Refreſhment of Nature, and to the Recreation of our exhauſted Spirits, ſo it ſometimes proves more ſafe, and leſs Expenſive to ſeek the ſame Effect from Solitude. To illuſtrate this Point a little, let us ſuppoſe a man, who for a-long time has been harraſs'd and wearied with the Proſecution of a Vexatious Suit, of ſuch a one, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, who, being in ſome Subordinate Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the Government, and who, Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Irregular Motions of greater Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, where he meets with nothing but Repulſe, and what is worſe, Delay, is at the ſame time baited by others of Inferiour Quality, who, as they are more Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, ſo are they generally more Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and Unſeaſonable in their Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. To this, let us add the continual Noiſe and Ordure of the Town, the bad Accommodation he meets with, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:100787:157"/>
the diſproportionable Expence he is oblig'd to lie at, for the Bribing Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and perhaps for the Conveniencies of Life: When a Man, I ſay, has for a long time lain under all the Tortures of Purſe, Body and Mind, and is upon the matter, at the laſt Gaſp; let us ſuppoſe ſuch a one to make a Truce with his Cruel Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Buſineſs, and to ſeek his Recovery from ſome Remote and Solitary Retreat. No ſooner is he arriv'd to this place of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, but he finds a Benefit in the Change, he who before was in a continual Circulation, and hurried about with the Rapid Motion which is annexed to the Circumference of Fortune's Wheel, is now in his Centre. Every Breath of Air he ſucks, is like Balſam to a Bleeding Wound, his Paſſions Cool, his Blood runs Calmly, and within the Banks, and all things tend to Tranquillity and Reſt. Like a Man who lately come off the Seas, ſtands upon the Promontory, and ſees the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers he has eſcap'd: He compaſſionates the Miſeries of others, who are ſtruggling with the Waves, and are every moment in Danger to be ſwallow'd up. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the Foaming Monſter coming on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him with a roaring Noiſe, but his Footing is ſure becauſe he ſtands upon a Rock, and is above the Reach and Menaces
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:100787:158"/>
of the Raging Element. And as his Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on gives him Security, ſo does it afford him Pleaſure, when he compares the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous Ocean under him, with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſe of Heaven over him, of which he has ſo clear a View, ſuch as is infinitely more Immenſe, and is ever Beautiful and Serene. Now tell me what Herizon is like to this, where things ſo contrary and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, are at once repreſented to the Eye, and ſeem to terminate in one another. The Emblem reaches my Intentions, when I would compare the Storms and Agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this preſent Life, with that ſtate of Stability, of which, Retreat and Solitude gives us ſo fair a Proſpect. Beſides the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of ſuch Contemplations, let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Advantage which a Man of Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs has, when he can in Silence review his paſt Errors, and take new Meaſures without Diſturbance. All things ſuggeſt themſelves to his Memory faithfully and in order; ſo that Multiplicity of Affairs do not diſtract, nor falſe Informations blind his Judgement.</p>
               <p>From hence it was that the Founders of Religion and Government, <hi>Archimedes-like,</hi> have always drawn their Schemes with a profound Silence, and in places moſt remote from Converſation. <hi>Moſes</hi> retir'd to a Mountain apart, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:100787:158"/>
his Laws from Heaven. In like manner <hi>Numa</hi> and <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who were the Founders of two vaſt Monarchies, did frequently retire from all Humane Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, that they might Project without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption; and to draw on the Credulous Multitude to yield Obedience to their Laws; they pretended to have ſecret Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences with an <hi>Aegeria</hi> or a <hi>Gabriel.</hi> Whether the <hi>Sybils</hi> receiv'd their prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Hints from Divine Information, or from a profound Contemplation, I will not diſpute, certain 'tis that they liv'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſe, and in perpetual Solitude: The dark Grotta's or Caves in which they lay, gave them a clear Sight of Remote and Future Things. They who would ſee with more Exactneſs, contract their Opticks, and he which looks through a Chink or little Hole, will take a better Aim at the Mark, than one who gazes by an open Light. As for Spiritual things, and the Glories of another Life, 'tis certain that Retreat is of infinite Advantage. He who is in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of a deep Well, has a diſtinct Proſpect of the Stars which are above him, of which he could not have a ſight were he above ground and in the Sun-ſhine.</p>
               <p>To proſecute a little my Conſiderations upon this Subject, let us make a light Draught of that Innocent Pleaſure and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:100787:159"/>
which a Man finds when he is alone, if he may be ſaid to be alone, who is ſurrounded with all the pleaſant Scenes and Beauties of the whole Creation, with what Guſt does he taſt the chaſt Delights of Nature? How Acute are his Senſes, and how Sincere does every Object preſent it ſelf? At once he ſees all the Varieties of ſhady Woods, of lofty Trees, of fruitful Fields, and of flowry Meadows, together with diſtant Mountains, and their various Mixtures of Rocks and Valleys, of Light and Shadows, all which make a confus'd, but withall a moſt agreeable and charming Object. How Orient and Unſullied is every Flower, how admirable in its Contexture and Colour, and how untainted in its Smell? How refreſhing is it to him to ſit down at a Fountain Head, to hear the confus'd Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody of Birds, together with the Murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Chryſtal Waters; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with what Purity they ſpring and iſſue from the Womb? How Fragrant is the Earth, how Temperate is the Air, how Clear and Gentle are the Streams, how Spotleſs and Virgin-like does every thing preſent it ſelf? and what a charming Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor ſurprizes him, and makes him a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Priſoner to his own Felicity? All his boyling Paſſions are here extinguiſh'd, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge is evaporated, and he fears not to
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:100787:159"/>
be proſecuted by Treachery and Envy. The Rage of Ambition does now begin to leave him, and he finds the Torments of Love give place to the chaſter Charms of Nature. Here he may turn and toſs his Thoughts with Safety, and give Vent to the Troubles of his Breaſt: Here he may expoſtulate the Injuries of Fate without Danger of being over-heard, and without the Terrors of an Arreſt; in a word, here Pleaſure and Security, here Health and Tranquillity do raign. 'Twas with good reaſon that <hi>Epicurus</hi> made choice of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens to teach in, when he propos'd Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for the chiefeſt Good; and let any Man of Senſe tell me, tho never ſo Senſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, whether a ſtate of Solitude, ſo Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and Delightful, ſo Calm and Sedate as that which is now preſent to our Thoughts, be not infinitely beyond all the Recreations which Drink and Good-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows can pretend to, nay beyond the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of Courts, where we meet with many Diſguſts, and little Entertainment but Ceremony and Noiſe. Upon this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration doubtleſs 'twas, that two of the greateſt Monarchs that ever raign'd, <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clefian</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, abandon'd the Pomp of Empire in the midſt of all its Fortunes and Flatteries, that they might enjoy the Pleaſures of Solitude; and were
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:100787:160"/>
I in Circumſtances to make my Choice, I would preferr the Garden and little Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a <hi>Carthuſian</hi>'s Cell, before the Walks and ſpacious Appartments of the Royal Palace. The Heathens certainly were ſenſible of this, when they conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Owl to <hi>Minerva,</hi> which Bird li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in perpetual Solitude and Obſcurity, is a pregnant Embleme of the Way, by which we muſt attain to Wiſdom.</p>
               <p>Such then are the Benefits of Solitude, which is to be enjoy'd ſo far only, as may ſerve to compoſe Nature, and to add new Vigour to the Spirits, but is not to be look'd upon as that State of Life, in which we muſt abide for ever. Man is born for the good of others as well as of himſelf, and is of an Active as well as of a Contemplative Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: 'Tis requiſite therefore that he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times change the Scenes, leſt, living al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in a perpetual Tenure of Life, that Eaſe ſhould at length degenerate into a Stupidity and Lethargy. Beſides, Regard is to be had to the Different Conſtitutions and Tempers of Men's Bodies. He who is of a Melancholy Nature, tho he dream of nothing but <hi>Elyſium,</hi> will in progreſs of time find his Dreams turn to <hi>Spectrums</hi> and Illuſion. Every moving of the Leaves will be an Ambuſh, and every Worm a Serpent. Every living Creature he ſees,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:100787:160"/>
will be a Wolf, a Dragon, and the ſoft Whiſpers on the Tree tops, will be like the Ratling of Spears and Lances; ſuch then is the Conſtitution of our Nature, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long continue in the ſame Poſt, but that which once was its Torment and Vexation, after ſome ſhort Returns of time, becomes its Refreſhment.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXX. <hi>Of Employment.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT being neceſſary for every man to be either in Company or alone, conformable to theſe two Stations, Divine Providence has propos'd to him two different Courſes of Life, <hi>viz.</hi> Employment and Study, the one being the Entertainment of the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and the other of the Solitary Perſon; and this it does with regard to the two grand Functions of Nature, Action and Cogitation, without one or other of which Man ſoon degenerates into a Beaſt. Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ſo eſſential to our Nature, that when the Thoughts have nothing Solid to feed upon, like Eager Spirits, they either feed upon themſelves, or rather than ſtarve, they faſten upon ſome unſuitable Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ripens into Vice. One who has neither Books nor a Calling, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy himſelf upon, is infinitely more tir'd, than he who groans under all the Fatigues and Incumbrances of Life. How tedious does the time appear, as tho it had loſt its
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:100787:161"/>
Wings? The conſtant Flux and Intervals of Day and Night, look like that Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary duration before the World was made, the Light of the one makes no new Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, and the Shades of the other yield no Refreſhment, Men's Parts, if they be not Exercis'd, like ſtanding Water, will ſoon Corrupt. How many are there in the World, who, for want of a due Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, languiſh hourly, they become Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent and Supine, and are at length ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd in utter Stupidity. Others, when their Spirits are Evaporated, as ſoon they will be, when there is no Recruit by a ſubſtantial Aliment, retain nothing but the <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> ſome dry, aduſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of their former Flames, which, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Melancholy, fills their Minds with a thouſand Vanities and Terrors. Others, who are of a Temper a little more Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, repleniſh their Imaginations with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Images, they form this or that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of things, and cloath their little Productions, with all the Beauties that Fancy can create: After this, they contrive how to give Birth to their <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera</hi>'s, and to try whether there be a real Pleaſure in the things themſelves; and thus they paſs from the falſe Pleaſure of Thinking, to the real Pain of Practiſing their fond Extravagancies. There is yet
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:100787:162"/>
another Sort of Men, who, being of a Reſtleſs Diſpoſition, entertain a vain Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their own Abilities, and to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their Animoſities upon the Publick, for ſome imaginary Diſgrace, they dream of nothing but new Modeling the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of Diſplacing Corrupt Miniſters, of Redreſſing Old Grievances, and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king new Alliances, <hi>viz.</hi> Betwixt thoſe old Friends, which have been ſo Conſtant always to one anothers Intereſt, Sedition and Treaſon. There are yet others who fly at a lower quarry, their chiefeſt Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies being Paſtime and Recreation: Viſits, Plays, Balls and Games, whether of the Field or Houſe, are pretty Amuſements to fill up the vacant Intervals of time, which generally are thoſe that fall betwixt the hours of Riſing and of Going to Bed; but they who are for a more Maſculine Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement, take their way to the Alehouſe or to the Tavern.</p>
               <p>Theſe and many other ſuch ingenious Inventions, are the ſerious Imployments of the greater part of Mankind, and are of wonderful Virtue to ſweeten thoſe ſevere Thoughts, which by the impartial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of ſome Important Duty, would go near to Strangle us. 'Tis foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh for Men to think, That becauſe they are Great, they may be therefore Lazy:
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:100787:162"/>
The glorious Luminaries of Heaven are in perpetual Motion, and are always ſtrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming down their benign Influence upon this lower world. The <hi>Turks,</hi> who, in point of good Oeconomy and Policy, are many times Clearer ſighted than the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, are very Remarkable in this, that even their Emperours, are oblig'd to make Profeſſion of ſome Art or other, to be the ſubject of their continuing Occupation, as well as a Preſident for others to imitate. We feed moſt heartily of the Game which is of our own Killing, and he doubtleſs, who eats of the Fruit of his own Labour, and drinks of the Wine which his own Hands have Planted, taſts with a better Reliſh and Appetite, than another who is nouriſh'd only by the Sweat of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Brow; and as his Labour finds him Meat and Sauce, ſo does it contribute to his Reſt, the Nights ſeem ſweet and ſhort, becauſe they paſs away in one ſound and continu'd Sleep.</p>
               <p>There is a Race of Men in the World, Men of Buſineſs they call themſelves, they are in a continual Hurry, and beat always upon the Hoof. If we offer to ſalute a Man of this Denomination, he cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſtay, he muſt ſpeak with this Lord and with that Gentleman, the time of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation is almoſt paſt, and ſhould he fail,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:100787:163"/>
'twould be of ſome hundred pounds Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage. Whoſoever conſiders this Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier, how he Trotts, Sweats, and Pants, and Ladders at the Mouth, would really believe that the very Government were in an Agony, and yet at the end of his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, he is not one Step further advanc'd upon his way, than when he firſt ſet forth, and like the Horſe in the Mill, though he walk about from Morning to Night, he is ſtill in the ſame place and round, and is perhaps as poor and blind too. Theſe then are the Flies which, ſitting on the Chariot Wheel, admire themſelves, and imagine all the Duſt they ſee, to be rais'd by the fluttering of their little Wings. There are yet other buſy Flies too, whoſe Property 'tis to vex all they faſten on, not only by buzzing always about their Ears, but by ſtinging them too by their unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and importunate Offices: Such a one pretends great Friendſhip to every one he meets, and will be a part of his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence whether he will or no, and having little or no Buſineſs of his own to do, he will be giving Advice always in another's. If his Affairs ſucceed well, he arrogates all the Glory to himſelf, by telling the World that 'twas he who put him in the way; but if they ſucceed ill, he will not fail to reproach his pretended Friend, in all
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:100787:163"/>
places wherever he comes, ſaying, That had he hearken'd to my Advice, it had been otherwiſe with him, but he may thank himſelf. Miſerable is the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Man who falls amongſt ſuch Inſects, and yet they ſwarm in ſo great Plenty every where, eſpecially in the time of Sun-ſhine, that 'tis almoſt impoſſible to avoid them.</p>
               <p>The firſt Entrance into Buſineſs, is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended generally with ſome Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the Threſhold is the place at which we are moſt apt to ſtumble: Whoſoever therefore would enter upon a Courſe of Life, by which he would make his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, ought to guide himſelf by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of others who are well advanc'd in Years, and have, for a long time, been accquainted with the Road he is about to travel in, otherwiſe he will be ſtill chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Meaſures, and be ready to quit his Deſign upon every little Difficulty. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conquer'd this Paſs, his Journey will ſeem Pleaſant, and 'twill be as difficult for him to leave the way, as it was at firſt to find it: Frequent Practice will beget a Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and when he begins to taſte of the ſweet Fruits of Induſtry, <hi>viz.</hi> Profit, and perhaps Honour, theſe, like Whip and Spur, will make him double his Pace. By conſtant Exerciſe the Man is always
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:100787:164"/>
kept in breath, and feels a vital Heat in the quick Circulation of his Spirits: Every Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty ſtands Sentinel, and does diſcharge his Duty upon the firſt Alarm; ſo that his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is Polite, his Parts are Florid, and the whole Contexture of his Actions is Nervous and Maſculine. But if he be a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who has a publick Charge and Figure in the Government, the Reſpect that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutes him in Places where he is preſent, and the Fame which proclaims him in Places more remote and diſtant, and the publick View of all, to which he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, cannot chuſe but create in him a firm and generous Reſolution, to preſerve himſelf in the ſame honourable Station, by all laudable and noble Actions. The Truth of it is, If there be any thing which may make Ambition a Virtue, it conſiſts in Uſing the Opportunities it gives us to Oblige and to Reward, and yet this Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation would become Abortive, were it not advanc'd upon the Theatre, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with Dependencies.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXI. <hi>Of Study.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THey who are qualified with publick Employments are few in number, compar'd with others, who, tho of equal Merit, by reaſon of ſome croſs Influence under which they lie, ſeem condemn'd to Obſcurity and to perpetual Retreat. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is, there is not that perſon living, who has the Soul and Spirit of a Man, but by the Improvement of his Natural Parts, he may reap Benefit from his Private State, and may be uſeful alſo to the Publick if he pleaſe, I mean by the way of Study and Learning. By Study, I do not underſtand that Amuſement of Thought, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts only in Contemplation, and in a calm Review of the ſeveral Accidents of Life, which kind of Reflection is in it ſelf very Innocent and Pleaſant, and is moſt uſeful alſo to Devotion; but by Study I intend ſomething more Severe, as being an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Inveſtigation and Reſearch of Truth,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:100787:165"/>
(yet unknown) by the Help and Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſuch Natural Mediums, as Reaſon does ſuggeſt; a thing, which tho it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in a Sedentary and Unactive Life, is really more toilſome, than the grand Employ of managing an Intrigue of State, amongſt all the Croſs Intereſts and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Foreign Courts: Witneſs the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Vigils, that Conſumption of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and the many Languors and Diſeaſes which attend thoſe, who bend all their Nerves and Faculties, and travel through all the Labyrinths of Argument, that they may at length arrive to ſome new Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. And let Men think what they pleaſe, they who are Succeſsful herein, are as Beneficial to the World, as thoſe who are in the perpetual Circles of an Active Life. The Influence of a Miniſter of State, rarely extends beyond the Limits of his own Government, and his Abilities deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine with his Life: whereas a Learned Man, by the Help of Printing, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in a thouſand places at once, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends his Power to Foreign Kingdoms, he makes his Conqueſt over all that is called Rational, and the Benefit deriv'd on Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, is as durable as the Books and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents in which 'tis Regiſter'd.</p>
               <p>To illuſtrate this Argument a little more particularly, I ſhall conſider the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:100787:165"/>
of Study, either in reſpect of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who makes it his Profeſſion, or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Publick. In reſpect of a Man's ſelf, its Fruit is Knowledge, which is a Ray of the Divine Perfection, ſuch as at the ſame time that it doth illuminate the Organ, doth draw it upwards alſo towards the firſt Fountain of Light, whoſe Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs can never diminiſh, and whoſe Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations are Infinite. The Mind of Man, Eagle-like, the more 'tis Irradiated, the higher ſtill 'twill be Riſing towards the Sun. 'Twould be infinite to expatiate over all the Fields of Knowledge; I have already touch'd upon Natural Philoſophy and Metaphyſicks, or Contemplation; I ſhall for Illuſtration ſake, only mention two Branches more of Humane Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>viz.</hi> the Mathematicks and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</p>
               <p>Firſt for the Mathematicks; if there be any Knowledge can charm a Thinking Man, 'tis this. It lays its Foundation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Principles very eaſie to be underſtood, but withall moſt Firm and Solid. The Progreſs is moſt Natural, being nothing but a Chain made up of ſo many Links or Propoſitions, of which one draws on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo that Reaſon here finds the greateſt Freedom and Pleaſure imaginable, in being ty'd to give Aſſent. If it be true what
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:100787:166"/>
ſome Philoſophers have with great Plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility delivered, That the chiefeſt Good conſiſts in having and Deſiring, or in ſuch a Fruition as does beget a further Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, and that Appetite a further Fruition, and ſo <hi>in infinitum.</hi> The Mathematicks certainly make the greateſt Shew of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us this <hi>Summum bonum:</hi> For no ſooner can a man arrive to the Knowledge of one thing, but that thing does diſcover ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and this again gives him a Proſpect of a third, and ſo on; the Underſtanding ſtill diffuſing it ſelf over infinite Regions of new Diſcoveries, till by a right Meaſure and Number, it is at length able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the Face and Greatneſs of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. Here then Satisfaction and Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite are ſtill interchang'd, whilſt we drink we thirſt, whereas in all other Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, be they never ſo great and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we find there is a Satiety, after which we begin to nauſeate and reject them. <hi>Alexander</hi> thought it to have been his greateſt Glory to Subdue the World, which when he had brought to paſs, to his own thinking, he then grew ſad and wept, that there was not another for him to conquer. Another great Benefit which we gather from this kind of Knowledge, is the Certainty of its Truth; it bears the Underſtanding in a full and clear View of
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:100787:166"/>
it; there are no Falacious Shadows of veriſimilitude, there is no Suſpicion of any latent Miſtake, turn and wind the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition which way you will, the Mind is in a full Acquieſcence, and in a moſt ſecure Poſſeſſion of its purchace. All other Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge how pleaſant ſoever, is but Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctural and Litigious, ſubject to perpetual Alterations, and leads the Enquirers, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times into Infinite Perplexities, and endleſs Contentions with one another: Whereas all are reconcil'd in this; <hi>Stoick</hi> and <hi>Peripatetick, Catholick</hi> and <hi>Heretick,</hi> will all agree in a Mathematical Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, which is yet a further Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the great Beauty and Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Truth.</p>
               <p>Next for Hiſtory, this muſt be confeſs'd to come ſhort of the Mathematicks, as to Method and Certainty: Beſides the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of Time and the Errors of MSS. we are led many times into the dark, by the Ignorance and Partiality of the Writers themſelves. No man can tell what was done in the Age paſt, but with ſome Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, nor what is done in his own Age, but with Danger. So that thoſe who are moſt Faithful, are many times leſs Knowing, and they, who have moſt Knowledge of Tranſactions, are generally leaſt Faithful, being drawn, either by

hopes of Reward, to flatter the Perſon, or by fear of Misfortune, to ſuppreſs the Truth. But notwithſtanding this, Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions in the Groſs are well enough tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Poſterity, and where they are Defective in ſome Circumſtances, there remains ſufficient for Inſtruction, and to entertain the Reader with Pleaſure. Here I talk familiarly with the wiſeſt Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; I have their Precepts for my Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their Lives for an Example, and their Deaths for my Encouragement. Here the grand Affairs of many Ages and Kingdoms, are at once offered to my View: Here I converſe with great Hero's, whom, in their Life time, I might not ſalute ſo much as with my Eye. Here I am admitted Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the greateſt Stateſmen; I know all their Conſultations, and more than what they themſelves for the moſt part knew, I mean their Iſſue and Events. I hear <hi>Demoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> Haranguing it in full Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. I ſee and hear <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Trajan</hi> ſpeaking to their Armies, with the Courage and Bravery of Soldiers, and with the Chearfulneſs and Clemency of Princes. I ſee them riding in their Triumphant Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots. I ſee them caſting down their Gifts upon the People, who at the ſame time return them again, by ſending up their Vows and Prayers for their Life and Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.

Great and Infinite are the Images which Hiſtory makes upon my Mind, and ſuch, in Compariſon of which, whatſoever can be repreſented unto me by my own Senſe and Obſervation, is moſt Trivial and Contemptible; how wretched then muſt the ordinary Accidents and Occurrences of Life ſeem to be, when they obtrude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon ſuch Noble Thoughts? All theſe privileges I arrive to without Attendance and Crowding, without Bribery and Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: I have Recourſe to my Books as often as I pleaſe, and when my Mind is Diſtracted with little Impertinencies, I divert my ſelf with the choiceſt Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and with my moſt faithful Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. Reaſon is the undubitable Birth-right of every Man; in this both Prince and Peaſant have a common Intereſt, and although ſome acquire a larger Poſſeſſion of it than others, yet all, by Nature, have the ſame Right and Title to it; ſo that I may challenge an Intereſt in whatſoever is Rational, whether Foreign or Native, or whether it be tender'd to me by the Living, or coveigh'd to me by the Works and Monuments of paſt Ages.</p>
               <p>But the Benefit of Study and Learning, will appear to be yet further Conſiderable in reſpect of the Publick. It is to Hiſtory that the Lawyer has Recourſe for Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:100787:168"/>
and the Stateſ-man for Counſel: It is from Hiſtory that a General may learn what Stratagems to uſe, what Dangers to avoid, and what Advantages or Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages may ariſe from Woods or Hills, from Winds and Rivers, together with what Countries are fitteſt to be made the Seat of War, and what Meaſures are to be taken with Allies, with whatſoever elſe relates to the Military Art. It is from Hiſtory that Princes take their moſt ſecure Directions: Here they will find the cunning Arts, by which Popular Faction and Rebellion may Uſurp upon them, and by what Methods they may be Suppreſſed. Here they may learn what Dangers may ariſe from Senſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Pleaſures and Flatteries, from too much Security and too much Remiſſneſs. In a word, here they may find the whole Art of Government, and if they will not make, at leaſt they may read their Fortunes in the Examples of others: For tho Men die, and one Age ſucceeds another, yet we find through all the Revolutions of Time, that the ſame Cauſes, ſtill return, and yet Men are ſtill ſway'd by the ſame Luſts and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The Inclinations of Men in this Age, differ no more from thoſe of others in the Precedent, than the Productions of this year's Spring, differ from thoſe of the former year, that is to ſay, in Time only,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:100787:168"/>
not in Nature. So that tho they ſeem to vaniſh and dye, yet a new Concurrence of the ſame Cauſes, will not fail to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the ſame Effects.</p>
               <p>Next for Natural Philoſophy, 'tis this which penetrates into the Cauſes of all Productions, it underſtands the Mixture and Virtues of Bodies, whether Plants or Minerals, with their ſeveral Qualities and Uſes. It unfolds the Secrets of Rarefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Condenſation, of Light, Heat and Motion; it ſearches into the Fabrick of Man's Body, and underſtands the uſe of every Organ, as alſo the ways by which Generation, Nutrition, and Senſation are brought to paſs, ſo that whatſoever Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick can contribute to Life or Health, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from hence. In the laſt place, for the Mathematician, 'tis he who teaches a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral the Art of Fortification, and Encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, as alſo all the Figures of an Army, with all the Military Engines of Death and Battery. An <hi>Archimedes</hi> ſitting in his Study, was, with his Rule and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, able to Defend <hi>Syracuſe</hi> againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Army. 'Tis the Mathematician who ſupports Commerce and Traffick, by teaching Navigation; he meaſures the Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an by Longitudes and Latitudes, he bridles the Overflowing Sea, and upon the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and Unſtable Waves, marks out
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:100787:169"/>
Roads to all Parts of the World. He gives the Figure and Dimenſions of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, he divides the Earth into Climates, and fixes the Boundaries of Kingdoms. To him the Merchant has recourſe in all his Calculations, to him the Husbandman's oblig'd for all his Inſtruments, and by him he is taught to Level and Survey. 'Tis he who gives Directions, for raiſing ſtately Palaces, for Deſigning of Triumphal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and for the Building of uſeful Bridges, and Aquaeducts. 'Tis he who gives the Symmetry of Sculpture, the true Diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Perſpective, with the Proportions of Figures and Feature. In a word, all Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical Works with the Curioſities of Art, together with whatſoever elſe is uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Ornamental, are the Effects of his Invention. 'Twould be endleſs to run through all the Liberal Arts, or to ſpeak of the Uſefulneſs of Ethicks, of the Power of Rhetorick, of the ſweet Delights and Charms of Poetry, with all the Benefits which acrue to Man and Nature from Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. It is ſufficient only to have pointed out ſome General Inſtances, from whence it does appear, That all the Bleſſings of Nature, as alſo all the Ornaments and Comforts of Life, are deriv'd from the Solitary and Thinking Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:100787:169"/>
It has been obſerv'd indeed by ſome, That Learned Men are not fit for Buſineſs, being taken up with general Speculations, and that they never deſcend ſo low, as to the Infirmities and Defects of Nature. The ſweetneſs of Repoſe makes them ſhun La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and if at any time they enter into Buſineſs, the Noiſe Deafens them, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Humours Diſguſt them, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Thoughts, Labour and Anxiety wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries them, and the Multiplicity and Weight of Affairs, does at length overwhelm them to the Ground. 'Tis obſerv'd alſo of ſuch, That being for the moſt part of an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Converſation, they judge of others by themſelves, and ſo coming into the World, they take falſe Meaſures of Men, and find their Error when 'tis too late. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, living a Sedentary Life, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from Company, they are Timorous and Soft in their Looks, which ought to be as firm as Steel, being to confront Men of Impudence, and to curb the potent Corruptions of the Times. 'Tis true, there are many bookiſh Men of a Cold and Fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Temper; their conſtant Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Study, makes their Blood reſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and they are ſo far from diſcovering any Capacity to govern others, that they know not how to manage themſelves in ordinary Converſation, being Mopiſh,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:100787:170"/>
Sneaking, and Speaking always in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-time. The leaſt Form of Complement puts them into Confuſion, and makes them commit a thouſand Abſurdities. Their Geſts, Habits, and Expreſſions are all Comical and Ridiculous, and any brisk Attaque puts them out of Countenance. Theſe and ſuch like are the Diſgraces, to which hard Study, and eaſie Nature, do many times betray Men.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding this, as it hath been already in ſome meaſure demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo will it further appear, That Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in its due Extent and Latitude, is extremely requiſite even in Civil and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Employs. Learning, properly, is not a perpetual Poring upon one Topick, it is not a piece of Pedantry; it is a Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Men, as well as of Nature, and its Object is as Large and Univerſal, as the Notion of a Being. It conſiders things in their remoter Cauſes, and by a Methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Train, and Connexion of Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it draws the Judgment to aſſent to ſomething which was unknown before. It Meaſures and it Computes: It Multiplies and it Divides: It Unfolds the Significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Languages, and Comprehends the Tranſactions of former Ages: It Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the Diverſities of Climates and Countries, and can make a Diſcovery from
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:100787:170"/>
thence of the ſeveral Inclinations, Intereſts, and Diſpoſitions of Men. It knows the Bent and Fabrick of the Paſſions, and in Conformity to them, it teaches us to frame our Actions, and to form our Expreſſions. Theſe and many others are the Benefits of Learning, and ſuch as I take to be Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially requiſite, in one who is Qualified with any conſiderable Truſt in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: 'Tis true, with all this there muſt be joyn'd Experience, which cannot be acquir'd, but by entring into the ſeveral Converſations of Men; to which let me add, a juſt Balancing of things with things, an impartial Survey of our own Capacities and Defects, a ſagacious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of what may hinder or advance our Counſels, an exact Accommodation of the Wheels to one another, together with a ſteddy Patience and Reſolution, which, like a Spring, ſets the Engine going, and keeps it in Motion to the end.</p>
               <p>'Twas with great Signification that the Poets feign'd <hi>Minerva,</hi> to be the Goddeſs of Arms, and the Patroneſs of Arts; for if we have Recourſe to Examples, we ſhall find that Learning and Empire, did ever grow up and flouriſh together: This we find verified in the ancient <hi>Thebans,</hi> and in all the Principalities of <hi>Greece,</hi> excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Sparta.</hi> Amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> when
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:100787:171"/>
was Empire in greater Glory, than in the Times of <hi>Auguſtus?</hi> yet when did Arts flouriſh more? And even his Predeceſſor <hi>Julius,</hi> the greateſt Hero that ever liv'd, and Founder of that vaſt Monarchy, at the firſt was but a Pleader at the Barr: And <hi>Scipio,</hi> one of the greateſt Generals the World ever had, was ever in his Study, and at his Book, when he could but gain a few minutes Reſpite from the Duties of War, converſing always with <hi>Polybius,</hi> and <hi>Panaetius,</hi> the two great Maſters of that Age, for Humanity, and all Polite Literature. From the times of <hi>Nerva</hi> down to <hi>Commodus,</hi> we find a Succeſſion of Wiſe, and moſt of them Learned Princes, and the happieſt Age that ever that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire knew, whether we conſider its vaſt Extent, or the great Felicity and Peace in which 'twas govern'd. Amongſt the <hi>Goths</hi> there was none ſo Famous as <hi>Theoderick:</hi> After many Ages of Confuſion and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſm, he made <hi>Italy</hi> again to flouriſh, and this chiefly by the Conduct of that great and learned Man <hi>Boeuml;thius.</hi> But not to run beyond the Limits of our own Kingdom, who amongſt the <hi>Saxons</hi> was a greater Encourager of Learning, than King <hi>Alfred?</hi> yet who was more Victorious in Arms, or more Wiſe and Regular in the Adminiſtration of State? And to come
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:100787:171"/>
nearer to our own Memory, when was the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation ſo Happy, as under the long and glorious Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth?</hi> who was known to have been not only the moſt Learned of all her Sex, but to have exceeded alſo, in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, all the Monarchs and Princes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom then living, and was not Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the Beſt of them in Wiſdom and all Princelike Virtues.</p>
               <p>In this later Age, we may obſerve two very remarkable things, which have much advanc'd Learning, of which the firſt was the Art of Printing. This moſt Ingenious Invention (tho ſometimes of Pernicious as well as of Uſeful Conſequence) preſently ſet the Wits of that Age a-work, in ſearching Libraries, and publiſhing good ancient Authors, with all Correction imaginable; whereas for many Ages before there was nothing to be heard of in the World, but the Jarrs of <hi>Scotiſts</hi> and <hi>Thomiſts,</hi> of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals</hi> and <hi>Reals,</hi> with ſuch like Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies: And how Induſtrious ſoever theſe Authors ſeem'd to be, their Learning was little, and their Benefit leſs, except it were to create Diſputes and Niceties about Religion, which afterwards turn'd to their own Damage. Great indeed are the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages we enjoy from Printing; for by this means Mens Thoughts are preſently
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:100787:172"/>
diffus'd through all Parts of the World, and this too in a Character which all Men can read. A Man may now procure a whole Library at a Cheaper Rate, than formerly a Volume; beſides, the Minds of Authors are more certainly known when they are publiſh'd in this way, than when they are Copied from hand to hand, by thouſands of Perſons, and ſo tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted down through ſeveral Ages, in which caſe there muſt needs be great Errors, from the Ignorance, Negligence and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality of Tranſcribers. But not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud Antiquity of what is juſtly due, their Induſtry certainly deſerves Praiſe and Commendation, who, upon ſuch great Diſadvantages, did perform ſo much. 'Twas a matter of great Expence then, for a Man to buy a Book or two, and the Work al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of his Life to tranſcribe them: And even they, who had the Benefit of Publick Libraries, could not meet with the tenth Part of that, which every common Shop is now furniſh'd with, tho it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd withal, that if this Invention has produc'd more Wheat, ſo has it produc'd more Tares and Traſh too.</p>
               <p>Another Remarkable thing, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd the Reformation of Learning, was the Diviſions about Religion: This hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening not long after the Invention of
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:100787:172"/>
Printing, Men's Wits, as well as their Pens, were by Reciprocal Provocations, ſharpned, ſo that with all Induſtry they apply'd themſelves to review the Fathers and Counſels, with other Monuments of Antiquity, and to Examine one another's Writings, with all Imaginable Exactneſs. Many Great and Learned Men appear'd on both Sides, and amongſt thoſe who adher'd to the Papacy, there were none more Eminent than the Jeſuites, who, to give them their due, have left infinite Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of their Indefatigable Induſtry and Learning, not only in Matters of Controverſie about Religion, but in Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo to Humane Literature.</p>

               </head>
               <p>I Shall not here diſcourſe of Celibacy and Marriage, in relation to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Benefit, for 'tis moſt certain that the latter has much the Advantage of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, as being that, without which, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind would ſoon decay, and be extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. The Meaſures therefore which I take of theſe two States, ſhall be with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the particular Parties themſelves. Should a Man only ſingle out and expoſe to View, all the Advantages of which one State is Capable, as alſo the Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies only to which the other is Liable, 'twere not Difficult to make either of them appear Happy or Miſerable, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Fancy and Partiality of the Writer: Therefore I ſhall put them both into the Balance, and with an Indifferent Hand, weigh them with all their Circumſtances, whether Good or Evil. The different Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:100787:173"/>
of Marriage, according to the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Countries, have been almoſt Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and cannot therefore be ſpoken to, without exceeding the juſt Limits of an Eſſay. As for the Ends for which Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was inſtituted, they are either Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as Pleaſure, and the Propagation of Mankind; or elſe Civil, as mutual Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Augmentation of Fortune, Procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Friends, by the Acceſs of new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, with many ſuch like Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Advantages.</p>
               <p>As touching the Propagation of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Species, the Eaſtern people ever eſteem'd of precoſe and early Marriages, excepting only the <hi>Spartans,</hi> who being a Warlike Nation, conceiv'd that Men of Maturer Years, were fitter for Conjugal Duty, and would beget a more luſty Race. On the contrary, the <hi>Romans</hi> Married Young, and by the Papian Law, thoſe who abſtain'd till the Age of 25. or there-abouts, were uncapable of Receiving or Giving Legacies, and degraded alſo from many Civil Priviledges. Polygamy is a kind of Matrimony, which, how pleaſing ſoever it may be to Nature, is no way conſonant to Civil Society: For beſides the Emulation or Jealouſie, which muſt needs ariſe amongſt many Wives, to the utter Diſturbance of a Family; 'tis certain alſo,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:100787:174"/>
(how great a Paradox ſoever it may ſeem to be) that it is a great Hindrance to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, as appears to this day by the <hi>Turks:</hi> For tho their Country be ſo Vaſt and Spacious, yet is it in a manner Deſolate, compar'd with ſome Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and yet the Inhabitants of <hi>Turky,</hi> are above two thirds of them <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Jews.</hi> The Reaſon hereof is not Difficult to give; for admitting there is an equal Number both of Men and Women born into the World, let us ſuppoſe, for our purpoſe, that there be one hundred of each Sex. Let five Men therefore take but five Wives a-piece, there will remain by this Account, but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty five Women, to be Married to nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five Men, ſo that twenty Men muſt of neceſſity want Wives: And the Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the ſame in any number whatſoever, tho never ſo great. 'Tis true, we read of old, That the <hi>Jews,</hi> to whom Polygamy was indulg'd, were very Numerous; but this certainly proceeded not from that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, but from the particular Temper and Conſtitution of that People, or from ſome other ſecret Cauſe, for even at this day, tho they be made to conform in this particular, to the Nations amongſt whom they live, yet are they more Numerous than ever they were in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſo that, were they united into one
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:100787:174"/>
Body, they would exceed, in Number, any Nation now extant upon the Earth.</p>
               <p>The Celebacy of the Clergy in <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Countrys, muſt be admitted alſo to be ſome Hindrance to Increaſe, tho not ſo much as is pretended: For we ſee in <hi>France,</hi> notwithſtanding their nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Clergy, and the many thouſands of Religious Houſes, that they are ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Populous. 'Tis true, 'tis not ſo in <hi>Italy,</hi> but there are other Reaſons to be given for this, beſides the Celibacy of the Clergy. For beſides their frequent Caſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and beſides that Abominable and Unnatural Luſt, to which that Nation is addicted, by means whereof, the other Sex is leſs made uſe of; 'tis obſerv'd alſo in many Places, eſpecially in the State of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> that the Elder Brothers do uſually give themſelves over to Liberty, and to the Pleaſures of their Miſtreſſes, leaving the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dets to inherit their Eſtates, whom they look upon as noot her than Stallions, upon the matter good for nothing, but to marry, and to keep up the Family: It being a thing for the moſt part Indifferent with them, whether the Propagation be from themſelves or others, ſo it be from ſome, who are of the ſame Stock; ſo that Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews and Neeces, are held with them in the ſame Degrees of Affection, as Sons and Daughters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="358" facs="tcp:100787:175"/>
Mutual Comfort and Converſation is another End of Marriage. For a long Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance cannot chooſe but create a great Confidence, and where the Tye is Indiſſoluble, there is a Neceſſity of adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one to the other. They therefore who enter into theſe Engagements, ought well to underſtand one anothers Humours, and to pitch upon ſomething, which ſhall be a Laſting Cement to unite Affections, and to render Life Sociable, and this may be either from ſome Charms of Perſon; or what is infinitely more Solid and Durable, from ſome agreeable Inclinations and Conſent of Nature and Diſpoſition. They therefore are not in the happieſt Condition, who Marry only upon Report, as do the <hi>Turks,</hi> where all the Account they have of one another, is from ſome of their Relations, who are of the other Sex, and may freely converſe together, and diſcourſe the Point without Jealouſie and Diſturbance. One thing generally they take heed to, <hi>viz.</hi> to procure ſome of their Relations, who are of the ſame Sex, and of an Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the other Party, to get a Sight of the naked Body, which by the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of Baths, is not Difficult; and by this means, all Deformities and Sores are expos'd to View, which otherways would lie conceal'd under the various Arts of
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:100787:175"/>
Dreſs: A thing certainly which ought to be enquir'd into diſcreetly, and as far as Modeſty will allow, ſince the Deformity or Diſeaſes of the Parents, leave a Blemiſh and Taint, many times, upon their Iſſue; ſo that beſides the Content which every Man may propoſe to his own Fancy, he ought at leaſt to be as careful of his Race, as he is of that of his Horſes, where the Faireſt and moſt Beautiful are made Choice of for Breed; which thing, tho it be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd amongſt the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topians,</hi> might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted alſo as uſeful in a real Government, under ſome Circumſtances. And here again it is, that Princes are much more Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py than their Subjects: For by Marrying with their Equals, 'tis evident that the Greatneſs of their Quality, muſt allow them but a very narrow Compaſs to make their Choice in, and theſe peradventure ſuch as they never can ſee, till the Knot be tyed and all be conſummated. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of State force them many times to marry ſuch, whom the Dictates of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would Repudiate, tho it ſeldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that even thoſe Politick Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to which they ſacrifice their Private Enjoyments, are of any laſting Benefit.</p>
               <p>Encreaſe of Riches is look'd upon by moſt, to be a good Inducement to Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. 'Tis known to what a Greatneſs
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:100787:176"/>
                  <hi>Spain</hi> has grown by obſerving this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime, <hi>Tu Foelix Austria nube.</hi> They have gain'd more by the Diſtaff, than ever <hi>France</hi> could conquer by the Sword. And even amongſt us now a-days, he is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Fortunate and Diſcreet who marries a Rich Wife, tho perhaps the fair Lady, to whom the Courtſhip is made, with all the Proteſtations of Love and Honour, be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſome Warp'd, Toothleſs and Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd Hagg. Let a Gentlewoman be well Born, let her be Modeſt and Ingeniouſly Educated, if ſhe has not Money, ſhe muſt in all Probability die a Dry, Old, Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Maid, or elſe marry with ſome mean, inconſiderable Perſon: But if ſhe be Handſome, 'tis poſſible ſhe may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to be a Miſs; a Courſe of Life, as the World now goes, which many value before the Fortunes and honeſt Enjoyments of the Marriage-bed. 'Tis true, in Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, there is another third way for thoſe, whom either Fortune or Nature, have made leſs liable to be Courted, I mean Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Houſes, where all ſuch Perſons may, without Reproach, paſs away the Remainder of their Lives in a Creditable Retreat; but ſuch Expedients ſuit not with the temper of this Climate: If Fortune and <hi>Phillis</hi> be not allied to one another, there is probably no other Road for her to travel in,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:100787:176"/>
but the common High Way, unleſs ſhe can draw in ſome Rich young Fop, who muſt by all means have Spurs clapt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, that he may make the greater Jingle.</p>
               <p>Marriage, by the Acceſs of new Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, many times becomes the Inſtrument of Raiſing Mens Fortunes. He who mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Daughter or Neece of a great Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-man, or of a Man in Office, needs not diſpute a Portion, and even in the State, as well as in the Church, we may obſerve one fourth at leaſt, of thoſe who are the Mignons of the Times, to hold their Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by Lady-Service: So that what ſome have noted, That he who hath Wife and Children, hath given Hoſtages to Fortune, is true only in a Reſtrain'd and Qualifi'd Senſe, in as much as ſingle Perſons are leſs Diſtracted with Thoughts of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for others; and are in a far greater Freedom alſo, to take up their Quarters in whatſoever Place, or with whatſoever Perſons ſhall ſuit with their Occaſions: So that having their Spirits in greater Vigour, and having in a manner all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Living, within their own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, they ſeem to be much better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for chooſing all due and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Means, and to be much abler for Execution: And yet I know not, why one,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:100787:177"/>
who chooſes the one meet and neceſſary Help before-mentioned, may not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as Sage and Prudent as another, who, by Courting divers Humours, and by a long Train of Services, and of obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queous Applications, does at length make his way to Preferment; tho there ſeems to be this Difference between them, that one Walking by a borrowed Strength, when once that Support is withdrawn, if he be not a Man of much Perſonal Merit, he is in great Danger of Falling, or at leaſt of being ſtopt in his further Progreſs; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the other, like a Man of Health and Maturity, walks by his own Strength: He relies not upon Crutches, nor has he Leading Strings faſtned to his Shoulders to keep him from Falling. He treads his Ground with a good Aſſurance, and will, in all likelihood hold out his Journey to the End.</p>
               <p>As to Riches or Patrimonial Fortune, Single Men, living in Eaſe and Liberty, are commonly Profuſe, and out-live their Eſtates; whereas the Married Man, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Charge and Family, is oblig'd to live Frugally, and to purſue ſome Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Courſe or other, which in the end puts him in the Road of Getting, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints him with all the Ways and Arts, of thoſe we call notable and thriving Men.
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:100787:177"/>
ſo that as married Men are ſtill generally more Intereſted and Subtle in their Dealings than others, ſo are they leſs Sincere in their Affections and Friendſhips. Great is the Alteration betwixt the ſame Man married and ſingle: For it has been obſerv'd that, the Change does not only touch the Man, but alſo his Cloths, his Hat, his Periwig, his Linen, all is Married; every thing about him looks a little Over-worn and Smutty, ſo that the Man himſelf ſeems to be nothing but a Second-hand Garment, and what is worſt of all, he common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declines the Converſation of his old Friends, either out of Sullenneſs and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, or what's more probable, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome ſecret and malign Influence of his Wife; for many Women think that all Love is loſt, which falls not into their own Boſoms. But the Caſe is otherways with thoſe who profeſs Celebacy; for it being Natural to moſt or all Men, to Love to ſome Degree or other, they whoſe Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are not limited to one Object, are prone to Compaſſionate Mankind in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as hath been obſerv'd in ſuch who live under the Obligations of Religious Vows, as Prieſts and Friars. Love is like a Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, which, when it is not confin'd to one Chanal, does diffuſe it ſelf over all the Neighbouring Fields, and glides along
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:100787:178"/>
with a more ſoft and even Courſe; which kind of Love is far more Generous and Beneficial to the Publick, whereas the other tends only to a Man's Private Solace and Content. And upon this Account al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo 'tis that a Single Life ſuits well with the Profeſſion of a Clergy-man, for ſuch a one being conſtituted as a Spiritual Father, over many thouſands peradventure, he can never have that Tenderneſs and Care over ſo numerous a Family, who chains his Affections to his Domeſtick and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal Concerns. Beſides, the married Man cannot exerciſe that Hoſpitality, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form thoſe Works of Charity as the other, much leſs can he, who is always Sollicitous about the Maintenance and Fortunes of his Children, have his Thoughts free, nor purſue his Duty without great Diſtraction, a thing which is a little unpleaſant, and utterly Unſuitable with Men of abſtracted Meditations, and with the abſtruſer Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Divinity. As for the Objection which is taken from the Scandals, which are ſometimes given by the Unmarried Clergy, 'tis frivolous: For if we conſider the matter Impartially, we ſhall find more Examples and greater Scandals amongſt the Married, than amongſt the others, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they be Lay-men, or of the Spiritual Order. However 'twould be a thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:100787:178"/>
conducing to the Splendour of the Eccleſiaſtick Function, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Beneficial to the whole Church, that Celebacy ſhould be annex'd, if not to the Perſons, at leaſt to the greater Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the Church; for by this means no man would be reſtrained from Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, only in caſe he ſhould think it Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to change his Condition, he might be oblig'd to quit his Dignity, and not rob the Altar of what is Conſecrated to God, by converting it to the Uſe and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his private Family, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it be to maintain them only in a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Luxe and Splendour. Nor would this be a greater Reſtraint, than what thoſe lye under, who enjoy Academick Preferments, which, tho of leſs Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, are enjoyn'd in Prudence to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with a Conjugal Eſtate. But leaving theſe and ſuch like Conſiderations, to another Place, 'tis certain, That either State of Life has its proper Comforts and Troubles; ſo that the Circumſtances of particular men, differing from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there can be no certain Standard pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd in the matter, but every Man ought to be accounted Wiſe and Prudent, who chooſes that which is Suitable to his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, and moſt conducing to his own true Content and Happineſs.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXIII. <hi>Of Death.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere are three Things which make the Conſideration of Death very neceſſary. Firſt, its Certainty; next, the Uncertainty of the Time, Place and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and laſtly, its Conſequence. In Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of this Life, to which we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious, we are many times Remiſs and Negligent about them, by reaſon of their Contingency, being ſuch as may happen or not happen to us; and in caſe they do not happen, all our Thoughts about them are miſpent. But 'tis not ſo betwixt us and Death; this will certainly ſeize us, and therefore we ought to be always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to meet it, leaſt it coming on us at unawares, we fall into greater Streights and Diſorders. 'Tis a Tribute we all owe to Nature, it being as neceſſary for a Man to die, as to be born. Flowers, Leaves and Fruits live we ſee, but for a Year; they Spring forth, Ripen, and then drop off, whereas the Plants which bore them,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:100787:179"/>
may continue yearly to bring forth a-new, tho after a certain Flux of Time, theſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo are cut off, or of their own natures Wither and Dye. Individual Men, who are, as it were, the Fruit of a Tree, are of a much ſhorter Duration, than the Family or Stock they are deſcended from, and yet we ſee that the Stock it ſelf muſt at laſt decay: For Families which have flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed for many Ages, are at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to their Primitive Obſcurity and Duſt: Nay the ſtately Cedars, whoſe Wood is ſaid to preſerve all other things from Worms and Corruption, muſt at length fall; even Kingdoms and Empires, how deep ſoever they be rooted, and how wide ſoever they extend their Arms. 'Tis in the Power of Art ſometimes to prolong Life, but it is more the Practice of Art to Shorten it, but whatever Benefit there be, 'tis but a Reprieve at beſt, whilſt the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution is certain.</p>
               <p>There goes a pleaſant Story of a certain Emperour of <hi>China,</hi> who, amongſt his other vain Deſigns, had a great Deſire to make his Life Immortal. A certain Kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh Phyſician of the Court, who preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be well skill'd in preparing Drinks, gain'd Credit and Intereſt with the King, by giving out that he had a Secret, a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Divine Elixir, which would not only
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:100787:180"/>
Prolong Life, but Secure him from Death. The Potion was prepar'd and preſented to the King, in the preſence of all his great Officers and Miniſters of State. One a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt, endeavouring by all means poſſible, to divert the King from his fooliſh Fancy, but nothing prevailing, he made no more ado, but catching up the Immortal Cup, drank it roundly off. The Emperour fell immediately into a Rage; for believing that he was rob'd of Immortality, he preſently took Counſel what Death the bold Offender ought to ſuffer: At which the Daring Courtier, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing daunted, told him Smilingly; Sir, take heed what you do, for 'tis not in your Power to kill me, being now made Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, but if I am yet capable to ſuffer Death, there is no reaſon for you to be angry with me, ſince I have not rob'd you of the Immortal Cup, but undeceiv'd you only, and by my own Experiment, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd you from the Lies and Fraud of an Impoſtour. At this the Emperour was well pleas'd, and commended the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Behaviour of that Courtier.</p>
               <p>Let Kings flatter themſelves, or be by others flatter'd, with the Stiles of Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Invincible, they will yet find themſelves to be but Mortal, and more Mortal perhaps than other Men. Nor can
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:100787:180"/>
any Man upon ſight of a Scull ſay, This was the Head which Love or Victory did Crown, or ſhew a Difference betwixt Common and Imperial Duſt. If we look over the beſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, we ſhall find but few of them, to go off the Stage with dry Veins; nevertheleſs many of them found a way ſtill to make themſelves Immortal, for 'twas but for a Knight of the Poſt or two to Swear, That they ſaw the Soul of the Departed, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up to Heaven, and he was preſently Conſecrated. So great and ſacred is the Gueſt of Perjury, that if it be ſometimes Capable to take away Men's Lives, ſo it has been at other times as Powerful, and more Bountiful in giving Life and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality to others, and to make them Gods.</p>
               <p>Another Conſideration of Death, is that of its Uncertainty, in relation to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of it, and of this we have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Examples from all Places, Hiſtories, and Ages. There are a ſort of Knaves in the World who, by I know not what Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the Stars, pretend to Predict the Deſtinies of Men; and there are a ſort of Fools too, who are ſo Simple as to Credit them. Such Predictions are ſhot at Rovers, and if one of a thouſand come near the Mark, 'tis preſently the
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:100787:181"/>
Work of Art, tho if we examine ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, a little ſtrictly, beſides the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Falſity of almoſt all of them, the reſt depend much upon the Fancy of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and upon the Invention of the Repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who muſt make it ſeem ſomething Strange, to gain Attention and Applauſe. Indeed it ſo falls out ſometimes, that it is not Difficult to Foretel the Death of a Man, as in the caſe of ſome Diſeaſed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Malefactors, or where Deſigns are laid againſt another's Life, for here the Immediate Cauſes, whether Moral or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, are within our Sight; but to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel ſuch Events from General or Remoter Cauſes, or by any ſecret Inſtinct, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly vain. Strange Accidents indeed have ſometimes happen'd, as that of <hi>Calphurnia</hi>'s Dream, the Night before her Husband was murder'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this concludes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, it being no Wonder, if amongſt Millions of Dreams and Predictions, ſome one or two ſhould happen to be true. I know not whether he did well or ill, who when a flattering Aſtrologer made a Prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to Calculate his Nativity, ask'd him whether ever he had calculated his own, be told him yes; and that 'twas his Deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to live many years, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To whom the other reply'd that he was miſtaken, and that he knew better than the Stars, that
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:100787:181"/>
it was his Deſtiny to dye within an hour; for he preſently commanded him to be put to Death, and by this means made the Confutation of his Impoſture to be his Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>The laſt Conſideration of Death, has Relation to the State which follows it. They who are inſtructed in the Belief of future Rewards and Puniſhments, as alſo of their Nature and Duration, muſt needs have a mighty Concern upon their Thoughts, at the Approach of Death, which tho it may be very Inconſiderable, if we conſider it as a Tribute to Nature: yet when we look upon it as a Paſſage to Everlaſting Happineſs or Miſery, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chooſe but appear Terrible. Of all Men, they ſeem to be beſt prepar'd for this Hour, who have a good Aſſurance from the Juſtneſs of their Actions, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of their Lives. But above all, ſuch who think they die for the Confeſſion and Defence of what they do believe, to be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Truth, are of all others leſs liable to Fear, and do in an eminent manner Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge a Crown; on the contrary they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and many times ſeem tranſported with Ecſtaſie, when they come to their Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, and theſe are called Martyrs. Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite was their Number, and great was their Courage and Conſtancy, in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:100787:182"/>
Church, and even in later Times, we have many Examples in Men of all Perſuaſions, who have maintain'd their Opinions by Dying for them, and who ſeem'd to leave the World with great Appearance of preſent Comfort, and of future Happineſs. <hi>Jerome</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi>'s Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour at his Death, made his very Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to pitie and admire him; and the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> by the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Florimond Raymond</hi> their Adverſary, out-did thoſe of the <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; nay that execrable Impoſtour and Blaſphemer, <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> might compare with any of the Primitive Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, for Patience under his Torments, which yet were Exquiſite enough, tho ſhort of his horrid Impieties. We can draw therefore no good Argument to prove the Truth of any Doctrine, from the Conſtancy of the Martyr: For, where Men are once perſuaded they are in the Right, tho it be never ſo great an Errour, ſuch a Perſuaſion ſhall be as Powerful as the Truth it ſelf, and they will with Joy meet Death which as it puts a Period to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Calamities, ſo does it promiſe to open to them a Door to Eternal Felicity. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wefind that even good and pious men have been Timerous when they came to Dye. The Endearments of Life are ſtrong
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:100787:182"/>
Remarks, and the Conſiderations of Guilt and Puniſhment, which the beſt of Men ought to have before their Eyes, are able to ſhake the ſtouteſt Courage.</p>
               <p>They who ſuffer by the Hand of an Executioner, ſeem in ſome Reſpects to have an Advantage over ſuch as die a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Death. Firſt, they dye generally with leſs Pain, and the Pain they undergo is of leſs Duration, than that of thoſe who pine away by Sickneſs, unleſs it be in caſe of Torture. In the next place, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Senſes and Faculties, Entire to the laſt, ſo that they can fix their Minds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Future State, with more Strength and without Diſtraction. They can quit the Stage of Life with good Thoughts, tho the Infamy which ſometimes attends ſuch a Death, as alſo the Calamities it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails upon Poſterity, cannot chooſe but make it Bitter. We have many Examples of the Moraliz'd Heathens, who ſuffer'd a Violent Death with all Imaginable Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution: Some out of an Heroick Bravery; others upon the Apprehenſion they had of being in a more happy State; but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally upon a Perſuaſion of being reduc'd to the ſame Condition they were in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were born, believing no other Immortality than that of Fame, nor no other Rewards after Death, than the Praiſe
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:100787:183"/>
due from after Ages, upon the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their Vertuous Actions. And certainly with Men of this Belief, 'twas no ſuch Daring matter, to ſtare Death in the Face, and to Conquer all its Terrours by a Voluntary Submiſſion to it; for 'twas no more but for a Man to cloſe up all the Travails, Pains and Misfortunes of Life, with one Sweet and Eternal Sleep. Hence came theſe Reaſonings of theirs; if there be any Senſe after Death, the Soul then cannot but exult and triumph, for its Deliverance from the ſtreight Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Body: That which immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before was a Captive, is now ſet at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, 'tis advanc'd on high; it has a free and a full Proſpect of all the Glorious Sights in Nature: Here it looks down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all humane and Mortal things, with a kind of Pity and Contempt, it ſees all the Follies and Tranſactions of paſt Life at one View, and beholds thoſe Divine Myſteries clearly and diſtinctly, whoſe Knowledge formerly it had ſo often ſought in vain. But on the other hand, if there be nothing which ſurvives the Body, he cannot be miſerable who ceaſes to be: For if he has loſt much, 'tis yet much more which he does not fear. He is now at everlaſting Reſt; the Fears and Miſeries of Poverty, the Anxiety of Riches, the Vexations of a
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:100787:183"/>
Proceſs, do not devoure him. He is not tormented with the Furies of Luſt or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he is not Envious at another's Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor Sollicitous about his own. No pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick nor private Calamities diſturb his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>eaſures, no Scenes of Blood appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Eyes, no Dreams or Terrours of the Night diſcompoſe his Sleep: He does not hang in Suſpenſe upon the Event of future things, which fall out always for the worſe, he does not fear the Calumnies of the Baſe, nor the Frowns of the Great; he does not fear the Aſſaults of the Perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Aſſaſſinant, nor yet the more Dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and Mortal Wounds of a Perjur'd Tongue. In a word, the Evils he is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from, are greater than the Good things he is depriv'd of, and he is arriv'd to that Station of Security, from which he cannot be driven by Force, nor drawn off by Terrours. Why therefore ſhould any one be Sollicitous about another's Death, which will either make him Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, or reduce him to his firſt Nothing? If Happy, 'tis Envy to deplore him; if No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, 'tis Folly. 'Tis Death which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers the Priſoner from his Fetters, and the Slave and Captive from his Chain: 'Tis Death which reſcues the Servant from the endleſs Toyls of a Laborious Life, the Poor from Oppreſſion, and makes the Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:100787:184"/>
equal with Princes. Here Deſperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on finds a Remedy, all the Languors of Diſeaſe, all the Fruſtrations and Tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life, all the Infirmities of Age, all the Diſquiets of the Paſſions, and all the Calamities of Fortune, with whatſoev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> can make a man Miſerable, vaniſh in theſe Shades. Such as theſe were the Notions, which many of the more learned Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens had of Death: But for all this we find it Natural to moſt men, to ſeek the Prolongation of Life by all means poſſible. The Poor man in the Fable, when he had drudg'd all day in cutting and carrying Thorns, at laſt, ſpent with Heat and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, he threw away his Burden, and ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down upon the Ground, calls on Death to deliver him from his wretched Life: Grim Death preſently appears with his Javelin in his hand, and ask'd him what he had to ſay; Nothing, replies the good Man, but that you will be ſo kind, as to help me up again with my Burden. Tho we often cry out of a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Life, yet when once that ghaſtly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary appears, moſt men deſire to return to their former Burden, and to toil lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger amongſt the Briars and Vexations of Life.</p>
               <p>The beſt Courſe therefore that a Man can take, to fortifie himſelf againſt the
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:100787:184"/>
Terrours of Death, is, To think often of it. The Wolf in the Fable, when he firſt ſaw the Lyon, was ready to die with Fear; the next time he ſaw him, he was afraid indeed; but the third time he grew Bold to draw near, and to converſe with him: Hence it is that Soldiers, who converſe always with Wounds and Dying Men, are no ways concern'd at the Fall of others, or at their own Danger: But this kind of Hardineſs proceeds rather from Cuſtom, than from a well ſetled Conſideration. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſpeaking, that which makes Men dread Death, is the evil of Privation ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than of Pain. The Separation of Soul and Body, in which conſiſts Death, is probably without Senſe, and whatever Pains precede it, they are ſhort of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of many Diſeaſes, and of other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters which every Man meets with, ſome time or other of his Life. But to bid an Eternal Adieu to Wife, Children, Friends, Pleaſures, Pomps, Preferments, with all the Blandiſhments of this World, is unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to moſt Men, and to this Condition muſt the greateſt Favourite of Fortune be reduc'd. The beſt Conſideration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this Caſe, is that of <hi>Epictetus,</hi> who compares the Courſe of Man's, Life to that of a Paſſenger at Sea, where the Patron or Maſter of the Veſſel, being to
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:100787:185"/>
take in Freſh Water, or ſome ſuch neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Proviſion, ſets his Paſſengers aſhoar for Refreſhment: To paſs away the time a little, ſome fall to gathering Cockles, others Reeds, or ſome ſuch Toyes they meet with, yet ſo as to be always ready to leave them, whenſoever the Maſter calls his Men aboard: So in this Life, inſtead of a Shell or Bulruſh, thou may'ſt have a Wife, a Child, or ſome ſuch fond Endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But when the Patron of the Bark calls upon thee to leave the Land, be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to quit ſuch Fancies, and run ſpeedily to the Ship, leſt being left behind, thou fail to arrive at the deſir'd Haven: But if thou art Old, beware thou doſt not wander far from thy Veſſel, leſt thou be not able to reach it, when thou art call'd away. The Evil which comes unlook'd for, is moſt Aſtoniſhing, but when it is foreſeen, it is half Digeſted before it touch us. Let a Man remember that he is born Subject to the Law of Nature, and that, as no Man dies, who did not ſometimes live; ſo no Man lives who ſhall not ſometimes dye.</p>

                  <hi>Aemilius Paulus</hi> had two Sons of great Hopes and Vertue; of which one dyed four days before his Father's Triumph, the other, who rid with him in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious Chariot, dyed the third day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; two ſad Attendants to Uſher in and
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:100787:185"/>
cloſe a Triumph, upon which, he made this Reflection in his Harangue to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. <hi>When our Felicity was at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Pitch, I fear'd that Fortune would quickly change, and that Heaven had ſome Calamity in reſerve; whereupon I made my Prayers to</hi> Jupiter, Juno, <hi>and</hi> Minerva, <hi>That if there were any Misfortune hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the People of</hi> Rome, <hi>that they would divert it from them, by inflicting it upon my own Houſe and Family. 'Tis well therefore with us</hi> Romans; <hi>for the Gods, by being Propitious to my Prayers, have ſo order'd it, that you ſhould grieve at my Loſs, rather than I ſhould lament yours.</hi> Here was true <hi>Roman</hi> Metal, or rather <hi>Christian,</hi> had the Object of his Devotion, been as good as his Intention. No Man will ever be fit to die, who in his Life-time cannot be Content to part with all Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Enjoyments, nor can any Man be thus prepar'd, who is not Moderate in the Uſe of them, and Diſingag'd in his Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for them; and indeed he who is thus diſpos'd, does really enjoy moſt: For over ſtrong Deſires and Delights leave Men ſubject always to great Jealouſies and Fears; ſo that the very Pleaſure of Fruition; is loſt in the Thoughts of being depriv'd of what we have in our actual Poſſeſſion.</p>

               <head type="sub">With ſome Conſiderations directing every Man towards the Attainment of his own Felicity.</head>
               <p>HAving, in the foregoing Chapters, Diſcours'd of Man, under the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Occurrences of his Life, I ſhall by way of Concluſion, ſumm up the precedent Conſiderations, by applying them to the State and Circumſtance of every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſon. This I ſhall endeavour to do, by ſhewing, That all the Bleſſings of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, how dear ſoever, are no Eſſential Part of Man's Felicity, but that his Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs muſt be deriv'd from other Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and ſuch as lie within our own Power. I ſhall not amuſe my Reader nor my ſelf, by Commenting on the Opinions of the Ancients, touching Man's Ultimate Happineſs or Good. Amongſt the old Philoſophers, the <hi>Stoicks</hi> determin'd it to conſiſt in a Tranquility of Mind, free from all the Perturbations of the Paſſions: Others would have it to conſiſt in a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:100787:186"/>
and interchangable Succeſſion of Fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Deſire. Amongſt the School-Men, ſome would have it to conſiſt in Intellectual Operations, becauſe Man's chiefeſt Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city ought to be ſeated in the Nobleſt of Faculties: Others, ſince good is the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Will, refer Felicity to this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, making it to conſiſt in Action, and in the Exerciſe of Vertue. From all which Variety of Opinions we cannot draw a defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, but collect only a deſcription of Man's Felicity by borrowing Light from each of the forementioned Seats. I conceive it therefore to conſiſt in perpetual Returns of New Deſires and New Enjoyments, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a Conſtant Serenity and Health of Mind. Neither do I limit the Object of Deſire to things purely practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, ſince whatſoever is the Object of Knowledge, is the Object alſo of Deſire; ſo that Deſire muſt extend to all Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Objects of the Underſtanding as well as of the Will. Now becauſe the Objects of Knowledge and of Deſire are Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and Infinite Objects cannot be at once preſent to the Thoughts of any thing that is Finite, there muſt be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite duration allowed to Man to make him Capable of receiving whatſoever may be the Object of Deſire, which can never conſiſt with this State of Nature, where all
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:100787:187"/>
is momentany and uncertain, and even the greateſt and moſt Permanent Productions are Circumſcribed by the Finite Periods and Revolutions of Time.</p>
               <p>Waving therefore this Ultimate Felicity of Man, which implys an Immenſurable or Eternal Duration, I ſhall determine the Conſideration of Mans Felicity, as it falls under the Circumſtances of Life, and ſhall Endeavour to demonſtrate that it is in the Power of every Man, Acting after the Principles of Natural Reaſon, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his own Felicity; and here I muſt borrow from the <hi>Stoick;</hi> for tho it be Impoſſible for a Man to arrive to that upper Region of Serenity, which lies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Winds and Tempeſts of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, nevertheleſs I believe it to be in the Power of a Man to defend himſelf from their Rage, to correct their violence, and to confine them within their proper Circles, which I take to be one great ſtep towards that Felicity I am now Diſcourſing of. Then for the Alternate Viciſſitudes or Returns of Appetite and Fruition, it is a thing no way attainable in this Life, for we deſire Infinite things, which we never ſhall, nor are ever capable to Enjoy. The uſe to be made of ſuch a Conſideration then, is this, that if a Man's Enjoyments do not reach the Meaſures of his Mind; let
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:100787:187"/>
him bring his Mind to the Meaſures of his Enjoyments, for whether the Hill come to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> or <hi>Mahomet</hi> go to the Hill, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not much, ſo they do but meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and I dare be bold to ſay, that he who Frames his deſires to the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Life, and to the Objects which lie before him, is really as happy as one that is in a warm Purſuit of all thoſe things, which lie within the Immenſe Proſpect of Mans Imagination. We have an Eminent Inſtance of this Truth in that famous Interview, betwixt <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Diogenes,</hi> of whom the latter certainly better deſerv'd the Name of Conquerour in the Dominion he gain'd over his own Deſires and Appetite, and did enjoy more within the narrow Circumſcription of his Tub, than the other could ever meet with in the vaſt Circles of the Univerſe. But leaving the Improvment of theſe and ſuch little Conſiderations, to the cloſe of this diſcourſe, it ſhall be my preſent buſineſs to enquire, whether amongſt that great Variety of things, which Men generally purſue, there be any which Anſwer the Real Ends pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by them, and are ſuch as can Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate them truly happy. I do not ſpeak of that Ultimate or Objective Happineſs of the School-men, which is ſaid to reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all the Capacities of the Mind (for
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:100787:188"/>
this can never be attain'd to in this Life) I ſhall confine my Diſcourſe only to that Inferiour or Subordinate Happineſs, which is the higheſt Perfection of this preſent Mortal State, and this requires theſe two Conditions. The firſt is, that it muſt lie within a Mans own Power, not only to acquire, but alſo to keep; for whatſoever good lies within the Command of another, is liable alſo to be taken from him, which muſt needs leave a fear upon the Mind, and ſuch a fear can never conſiſt with true Happineſs: it muſt be therefore durable. The next Condition of Mans Happineſs, is, that it be not deprav'd with Evil, it muſt be therefore ſincere. Moreover I ſhall conſider Happineſs with Regard to theſe two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams. Firſt, I ſhall compare it with ſuch things as are commonly reputed good and deſirable amongſt Men. Next I ſhall compare it with ſuch things as are commonly reputed Evil and Hateful amongſt Men. The things after which Mens Deſires are uſually car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, are reducible to theſe two Heads, <hi>viz.</hi> Senſual Enjoyments, and the Goods of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which are ſuppos'd always to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with profit.</p>
               <p>I ſhall firſt begin with Senſual Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: I ſhall not inſiſt upon the great and many Diſappointments we meet with in our Purſuit of them, nor of the many Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:100787:188"/>
of our Paſſions, together with the Conflicts betwixt Hope and Fear, and the great fatigue, hazard and Expenſe they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten undergo, who endeavour to purchaſe them: Neither ſhall I enlarge upon the Fruits and Conſequences of theſe Delights, being for the moſt part ſuch as end in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, and in a conſumption of Reputation and Fortune. I will therefore State Senſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Felicity, with all the advantages that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination can repreſent it under; I will ſuppoſe a Man to enjoy his fill, and to ſit to be Arbitrator of Luxury and Delight: Let us ſuppoſe him to look backwards on what is paſt; and whilſt he exults in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of it, let us ſuppoſe him alſo to be entring upon freſh contents, and to be raiſing his Hopes and ſharpning his Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite for the perception of them; and thus whilſt his Body fattens or rather Surfeits under preſent Fruition, let his thoughts run forwards in the queſt of new and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſted Peaſures, which let us ſuppoſe to flow in as eaſily upon his Soul as Wiſhes, and as the productions of thought upon the Mind. This certainly is the greateſt Heaven which the Voluptuous Man can Fancy: yet then, <hi>Helas!</hi> how far ſhort will theſe Pleaſures fall of that Beauty, which Imagination Cloath'd them with? how ſoon are we tir'd with them? and when
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:100787:189"/>
the Senſe is ſatiated, then do we begin to Nauſeate the Object, which when it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, how drooping and dejected are the Spirits? how Flat and Damp are all the thoughts? not ſo much for its abſence, as for the Fruſtration we meet with in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, till by the Proſpect of ſome new Delights which fancy offers, we whet our Appetites, and then run into the former Labyrinths of deſire and diſappointment; ſo that if whatſoever ſenſual thing we actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally enjoy, is only ſo far good, as it ſuits with Imagination, and if Imagination does ſhew things greater in Expectation, than under Fruition, it follows moſt cloſely how great a Paradox ſoever it may ſeem, that they who are under the Wants and Expectation of their Senſual Endearments, feel the greateſt Ticklings of Pleaſure. However it be, this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the Returns of want and Pain, are Indiſpenſably Requiſite to Enjoyment: and hence it is; that the Voluptuous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for Guſto's ſake, does Eat what is Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to give his Wine a Reliſh, and has Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to ſour Sauces, that he may make his Meat more Palatable.</p>
               <p>From Senſual Pleaſures, let us paſs on to conſider the Goods of Fortune, ſuch as Riches, Office, Honour, and the like: Theſe indeed are the things which the
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:100787:189"/>
greateſt uſually make Court to, as ſuch, from whence they promiſe themſelves all Felicity. And firſt for Riches, if we look upon Mans Happineſs to conſiſt in an accumulation of Temporal Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we muſt needs confeſs that they go a great way in the Purchace. Money is the common Meaſure of all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, or Ornamental to the Life of Man. It Conveys to us the Riches of Foreign Countries, with all the Productions of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry or Nature; It furniſhes our Tables with Exquiſite Wines and Meats; It raiſes ſtately Houſes, with all the Ornaments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them; It Cloaths us with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is found curious in Nature, or made ſo by Art; It procures us Offices, and if it cannot purchaſe Honour, 'twill at leaſt obtain us Titles, and Adorn us with the Liveries of Vertue; It wins us Friends, it ſubdues our Enemies, and makes a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt over Beauty. Theſe with Infinite other Bleſſings, are the fruits of Riches, And yet if we conſider them well, we ſhall find them to be like thoſe Medals, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent many times a Beautiful Face on the one ſide, and a Beaſt on the Reverſe; let us therefore turn them on the other ſide, and ſee whether they have the ſame Figure and Beauty throughout. I will not ſpeak of the Difficulty a Man meets with uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:100787:190"/>
in getting Wealth, nor of the Dangers and Temptations to which his Conſcience is ſometimes Obnoxious. I will imagine his Coffers fill'd, and that his Reputation is Stamp'd with as fair Characters, and with as Noble an Image as his Coyn; and yet ſuch a one certainly, if he be of a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Diſpoſition, cannot chooſe but be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted with thoughts, how to Diſpoſe of his Treaſure; if it lie by him in his Cheſts, it is no further Serviceable, than ſo much Earth, and lies ever in the way to Bait others to break in and Rob him, not only of his Gold, but Peradventure of his Life: if he leave it with the Banker, He has no other Security than the Word of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Man, who if he Fail either in Honeſty or Sufficiency all is gone; and how many there be who are Defective this way, is but too Legible upon the Walks of all the Burſes of <hi>Europe.</hi> If he purchaſe Lands, what Application muſt there be made to Scriveners? what Examinion is there of the Title? and when he thinks all ſafe, up ſtarts a Judgment or ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd Mortgage, which hath been Sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for many Years: then comes in the whole Cry of Lawyers, and after all the Methods of a Vexatious and Expenſive Suit, the Poor Client, if he be not Totally De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated of his Purchace, will nevertheleſs
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:100787:190"/>
find this after-game to be the dearer Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<hi>:</hi> for when he has ſpent the beſt part of his Subſiſtance amongſt his Advocates, he then will underſtand their meaning when they promis'd to make it out that he had a Clear and Naked Title; ſo that in the end he muſt be forc'd perhaps to clog the ſame Eſtate with a new Incumblance, that he may have wherewithal to ſatisfy his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, for the Money which he borrow'd to carry on the Cauſe, and ſo leave the ſame Curſed Bone for ſome after-Purchacers to gnaw upon, which certainly is the Caſe of many a Perſon.</p>
               <p>But admit a Man be yet ſo happy to be free from theſe Perplexities, and that he enjoy all the Bleſſings which Wealth can Compaſs without Care and Diſquiet; if he be ſuch a one as does Indulge himſelf in his Plenty, how eaſily is he betray'd to Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, and to all that Train of Diſeaſes, which follow Intemperance? Habits of Eating and Drinking plentifully, beſides the injury they do to Intellectuals, and the Stupidity which goes along with them, are ever attended with Surfeits, Feevrs, and Dropſies. The Gout ſeldom fails to viſit ſuch as live in fulneſs and eaſe; nor the Pox, thoſe who live in Wantonneſs and Promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous Pleaſures: But then, if a Rich Man live to the Rules of Temperance and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:100787:191"/>
what Natural Benefit has he above another, who tho of an Obſcure and mean Condition, wants nothing neceſſary for his Suſtenance, or Conducing to his Health? The Neceſſities of Nature, and the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Life lie within a Narrow Circle, ſo that whatſoever exceeds it, is not only Superfluous and Expenſive, but affords matter for Diſtemper. Great Men, and eſpecially Princes, the Wider is their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the more is their Liberty Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd and Limited<hi>:</hi> State and Grandure will not allow them to appear, but in few Places, nor this at all times. For the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, a Prince may delight in Beautiful Gardens, or the like; and yet there is ſcarce a private Subject, but may enjoy the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of them no leſs then He; Every Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman may Walk in them for his Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Entertain his Fancy in Viewing the ſeveral Beauties of Trees, Walks, Fruits, Flowers, Fountains, Grotto's, Statues, Shades, with infinite other Curioſities, with which ſuch places are uſually adorn'd, and all this at another Mans Expence, and when he has done, he may paſs over if he pleaſe into the Countries of other Princes, and ſee the like or greater Rarities, together with the Structure of their Palaces, and the Order and Faſhions of their Courts, ſo that this Pleaſure and Delight, be it what
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:100787:191"/>
it will be, 'tis certainly ſuch wherein the Subject has much th'advantage of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Prince, who upon Conſiderations of Government, may not paſs beyond the Limits of his own Kingdom, nor enjoy his private Recreations without Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance and Reſtraint. And yet the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Eye have been ever Eſteem'd ſome of the greateſt and the moſt Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Delights of Life. Let the Benefit of Riches be as great as Fancy can repreſent them, this is certain, That he, who does not enjoy Contentedneſs of Mind, will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be Miſerable, and perhaps more Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable the more he does poſſeſs: For Appetite becomes more boyling the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er fuel it meets with, and even that which is Actually in a Mans Power, will ever be ſubject to Chances, and give him continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al occaſions of diſquiet. They who ſpread wide their Sayls, and Deſplay all their Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very upon the Deck, as they muſt expect to meet with Storms, ſo they may be as certain too, that ſo great an Embarras will ſerve for little but for the Winds and Tempeſts to faſten on, which may end perhaps in the Subverſion of the Ship. When Showers of Arrows fall thick, 'tis the ſafeſt way for a Man to Contract himſelf into the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweſt compaſs that he can, and decline their force by Shrinking to the Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="392" facs="tcp:100787:192"/>
Greatneſs of Place or Honour, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Branch of the Bleſſings of Fortune. It is a kind of Diminutive Soveraignty, for it Impowers Men to do Good and Puniſh: It raiſes the Admiration of the Vulgar, and Creates Dependences. It gives Men a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence above others, and is Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied in all places with Marks of Pomp and Grandure. Theſe indeed are Colours Glorious as thoſe of the Rain-bow, nor is the Figure leſs Beautiful: Nevertheleſs if we make but a little near approach, we ſhall find the Orient Scene to be nothing but Apparition, or a thin Vapour which is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended generally with a Storm, and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes in an Inſtant. That ſome Men ſhould be advanc'd to Places of Truſt, and Honour, is abſolutely neceſſary for the Support of Government, but withal, were it not for the Ends which ſuch Men do or ought to Propound to themſelves of being Service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Publick, and were there not an inward Joy and ſatisfaction of Mind up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the performance of Duty, as well as a Reputation and outward Reſpect juſtly due to good Actions, I know not what it is that could invite Men to come out of a private and ſecure Station, to be toſs'd about under a Hazardous and Reſtleſs Courſe of Life: For here it is that they area-bridg'd, not only in their Recreations, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:100787:192"/>
of Speech, Converſation and Private Studies, all which are things in which Man's Temporal Felicity is abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, and are the ſincere Fruits of liberty, but many times they have ſcarce Leiſure for the Refreſhment of Nature, and for the Recollection of their Spirits. They are in a manner throng'd wherever they go, and tir'd with Impertinent Complements, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Ceremonies, and Formal Viſits. Nay even in their Cloſets and places of Retreat, they are many times Haunted with Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Importun'd with diſtaſtful and unſeaſonable Addreſſes. Their Tables, where Men uſually lay aſide the Burden of thoughts to Indulge themſelves a little in honeſt Mirth and Freedom, are made their Snares: Such Men are under Circumſtances of Eating always in a publick way; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe who are invited, it ſeldom happens but there are ſome who come with an Intention to Devour ſomething more than what is ſet before them. There is no Place where a Great Man is in ſo much Danger as at his Meat. In the midſt of Wine, and Feaſting Men are eaſily Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to caſt off their Maſques, and as they fill their Bellies, ſo they empty their Breaſts, by opening their Paſſions, and by giving their Tongues a little liberty. Now what can be more uneaſie than to have a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:100787:193"/>
Spy upon all the Words and Actions of a Mans Life, to be forc'd to Flatter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and perhaps be Poyſon'd by Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries himſelf? To be one while defam'd by Scandalous Libels, and at another time to be Murderd by ſecret Whiſpers and Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers? To be one while baited with loud Clamours and Obloquy, and to be by and by Arraign'd by Popular Paſſions, for his ill Adminiſtration and Evil Counſels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe unproſperous? What can be more Tireſome than to be haraſs'd always with Multiplicity of Buſineſs, and to be Tortur'd with Petitions, where there are many Competitours perhaps for the ſame thing, and where one only can be Gratifyed, which muſt need put a Man under a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Diſguſting all the reſt, and lay him open to their Defamation and Envy, and Envy ſeldom fails to procure Revenge? That which is but a ſmall Imperfection in a private Perſon, is a great Deformity in a States-man; and the Eminence on which he ſtands makes him more Conſpicuous. All his Actions lie open to the Day, and every little Folly will ſet him at a lower Value, and will never want Aggravation. If Cryſtals have little Bubbles in them, it matters not much, but the leaſt Cloud or Flaw in a Diamond does very much De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe its Price. How painful and almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:100787:193"/>
is it for ſuch a Man to carry a Chearful and Serene Countenance, whilſt he feels the Vulture Gnawing at his Heart, whilſt he Travels with Suſpicions, and finds his Meaſures Croſs'd? When he is moſt Solitary and Retir'd from Buſineſs, then are his thoughts moſt Agitated: he then feels the Sting of his ſecret Enemies, and the Blows and Wounds of his open ones, and caſts about every way to defeat their Contrivances. He is jealous of his Confidents &amp; Servants, and is ever and anon changing Reſolutions. He Groans with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf when he conſiders his Perplexed Condition, and is ready to Burſt upon the Apprehenſion of his Ruin; but if he once begin to Totter, off drop his Followers and Favourites like Leaves from a Tree, which is Nipt by the Froſt, and Blown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Wind, and in their places comes in the <hi>Turba Remi,</hi> the Canaille or Raſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the People, who according to their wonted Generoſity, ever Trample upon thoſe whom Fortune hath Abandon'd; a Brutiſh ſort of Creatures which delight to Prey on Blood, and herd together like Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to feed upon a Mangled Carcaſs: And this, God knows, is the Fate of many a Great Man, or if they do not fall into this Extremity of Misfortune, at leaſt they fall into Diſgrace. Nor is it the leaſt part of
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:100787:194"/>
their Torment to ſee their Enemies rejoyce at their down-fall, whilſt they themſelves have nothing but the Melancholy Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of paſt Greatneſs to feed upon, and this will prove Infinitely more bitter, than if they had never taſted of Honour: For if there be a Pleaſure and Satisfaction in Grandure, the greater 'tis, the greater will be the Misfortune to be depriv'd of it; ſo that 'tis a Madneſs to Purſue athing where the Evil of Privation outweighs the Pleaſure of Enjoyment; but if there be no ſuch Pleaſure in the Enjoyment, 'tis Equal Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to follow that with ſo much Eagerneſs, which is ſo empty in it ſelf, and is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of ſo many Calamities and Diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
               <p>And thus we ſee that greater Fortunes are really more uncapable of Happineſs than the mean; by reaſon of their large Retinues, and that vaſt Extent of Appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances which Surround them, they are too much Expos'd to Hazard: their Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city is made up of a Million of Members, ſo that the Multitude is a Burden, and the Defect or Miſ-carriage of one only, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to Embitter other Enjoyments. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Account we may obſerve that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Kings themſelves, when they would taſt the Sweets of Innocent Pleaſure, do di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt themſelves of themſelves, and that
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:100787:194"/>
they lay aſide all the Badges of Royalty, that they may be capable to diſcend to the Converſation of private Perſons They eſteem themſelves moſt happy, when <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogniti</hi> they can refreſh themſelves with thoſe common Recreations, which are the ordinary Divertiſements of other Men; and yet can they not enjoy even this ſmall Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Happineſs without danger ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, nor rarely without Detriment to Majeſty: for beſides the Contempt which too much Familiarity does Naturally draw along with it, they by this means give occaſion for others to Note their Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances, and to ſpy into their Diſpoſitions, and to diſcover their Secrets. For as Men are moſt open in the heats of Sport, ſo is it obſerv'd that the greateſt Traytors will ever mix themſelves with thoſe who do Accompany Princes in their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
               <p>In the next place let us conſider ſuch who effect Greatneſs upon the ſcore purely of Ambition and Glory, and we ſhall find them to be much more Miſerable than the former: For Ambition is a Fire which the more it finds to feed upon, the more it Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and when it has Reduc'd all things to Ruin, does it ſelf Evaporate into a Smoak, and even its more durable Parts are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to Aſhes. Is it poſſible for any

Man even in the moſt Proſperous Courſe of Fortune, to live without a Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and if he overcome one, will there not ſucceed another, who will give him Freſh and Stronger Diſquiet? Had <hi>Pompey</hi> dyed of the Sickneſs which Seiz'd him at <hi>Naples,</hi> he might have had <hi>Sulla</hi>'s Title ſuperadded to his own, and have been <hi>Pompey</hi> the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, as well as <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, but by attempting to gain the further Graces of Fortune, he loſt both; and even his Rival had ſcarce five Months Reſpite from his Glorious Toyls, for returning to <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>October,</hi> he was Murder'd the following Ides of <hi>March.</hi> I doubt not but that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Princes amidſt their ſerious thoughts have had Reflexions of this Nature; and would follow their true Felicity by a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Retreat, did not Conſiderations of Publick Duty make them prefer Labour before Repoſe, with Conſiderations alſo of their Honour, which might in after-Ages be Stigmatiz'd with Characters of Lazineſs and Stupidity. Nevertheleſs ſome of the greateſt and of the moſt Fortunate Princes of the World, as <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, have preferr'd Retirement before Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion: their Victorious Hands were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in Planting Flowers, which afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time gather'd Laurels, and 'twas with them a matter of Choice not of Neceſſity, to
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:100787:195"/>
leave their Triumphant Legions, that they might Erect an Empire over the Vegitable Sect.</p>
               <p>From what has been ſaid it appears a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly; that neither Senſual Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor the Goods of Fortune do any ways Anſwer the Conditions of Happineſs. Since therefore 'tis not to be found in any of theſe things which lie without us, but in the inward Gifts and Capacities of the Soul, I Determine its Nature principally to conſiſt in a conſtant ſerenity of thought, looking upon outward Comforts only as neceſſary Goods. Now how far it is in a Mans own Power to acquire this Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, will beſt appear by looking towards the other Extream before mention'd, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſuppos'd Evils which accompany this Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Life.</p>
               <p>I ſhall begin firſt with the Evils of Pain, which whether they proceed from out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Violence, or from Natural Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, certain 'tis that they Create Anguiſh, yet are they not ſuch as leave us without Examples to ſupport them, or deprive Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the means to overcome them. I ſhall not ſpeak of the Courage of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs under Tortures (where the Proſpect of a future Reward may be allow'd ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to give them ſome Extraordinary Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance) ſince amongſt the Heathens we
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:100787:196"/>
have abundant Preſidents for Imitation. The goodneſs of Providence does ſo order Matters, that the ſharpeſt Dolours are for the moſt part of ſhorteſt Continuance, but where they are of any Duration, we find even the Continuance of them to be a Remedy. 'Tis the firſt ſhowre that wets, and 'tis the firſt Inciſion of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet which ſmarts, thoſe which follow do rather Stupify than affect the Senſe with ſharpneſs. The Miſeries of a Gally-ſlave are great, and yet we ſee that when he finds himſelf under a Neceſſity of indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, he ceaſes to complain, and Rallies up his Spirits to ſuffer that with a Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Patience, which he cannot repel with any Armed Force. And when he is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time Inur'd to that Slaviſh Condition, Cuſtom by little and little, makes it Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable and Natural. But whatſoever there be in this or any Dolours of Life, the more Acute they are, the ſweeter are the thoughts of Death, whereas to one who makes Pleaſure his End, the greater it is, the more painful are the thoughts of quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Life; ſo that as the latter is in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of making his paſſage into Miſery, the other is always in a Paſſage to a better State.</p>
               <p>From the Evils of Pain, let us go on to conſider the Evils of Privation, ſuch as
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:100787:196"/>
loſs of Liberty, of Riches, of Friends and Relations, of Reputation with the like. Loſs of Liberty muſt be Confeſs'd to be a great Calamity, not only in its ſelf, as it cauſes the Name of Reſtraint and Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but in reſpect alſo of all other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts: for it not only deprives Men ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily of the Benefit of Friends, but does expoſe them to great Wants and Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and what is worſt of all it becomes many times Deſtructive to Health. Exile ſeems ſomething more uncomfortable than Impriſonment: for beſides that Divorce which it makes betwixt the deareſt Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Men Naturally have an affection for their Native Country, eſpecially when they are out of it, which Affection will be ever apt to beget Sorrow. But for all this, let us but Examine matters a little by detayl, and ſee whether Reaſon does not furniſh us with ſufficient Remidies.</p>
               <p>Loſs of Liberty like all other Evils which befal us, is greateſt in the beginning: Birds, when they are at firſt put into the Cage, do Flutter and Struggle, and refuſe to feed, but after a little Time, they return to their former Natures and Sing. Then for the Exigence of Nature it is eaſily ſupplyed, the Body requires no more but to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd from Cold, and a little is ſufficient to ſatisfy Hunger, and to Extinguiſh Thirſt,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:100787:197"/>
whatſoever exceeds theſe Meaſures tends to Surfeit, and makes Proviſion for Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. <hi>Seneca</hi> obſerves well of thoſe who In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge their Palats, that it is not ſo much the Taſt and Reliſh of the Meat, as the Rarity and Price which makes it Delicate. Now there is not the Place ſcarce upon the Face of the Earth, which does not afford Suſtenance for Life. To want that Variety of Delightful Objects, with which Men daily are Refreſh'd is no great Miſery, for 'tis in a Mans own Power to bring their Images into his thoughts, which is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Recreative as the External Objects themſelves; and if Confinement be ſo great a Miſery, then are they as unhappy altogether, who by Office or any other Circumſtances of Life, are oblig'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Reſidence, and ſo in a manner Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcrib'd within one conſtant place. Then for Separation from ones Country, 'tis not ſo great a Misfortune as it at firſt appears, for to whatſoever place a Man is Baniſh'd, tho ſeemingly never ſo Unhoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and Deſolate, he may obſerve great numbers of Perſons reſorting thither daily of their own Accords; ſo that what is made the Subject of Mens choice, cannot be ſo Incommodious and Intolerable. Nay, let a Man go into what City ſoever he pleaſe, he ſhall find great numbers of Strangers, who
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:100787:197"/>
live Contentedly and happy; which yet they could not do, were abſence from ones Native Country ſo great a Miſery.</p>
               <p>Privation of Friends and Acquaintance has been ever lookt upon as a great Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, and ſuch as leaves too great a damp upon the Spirits. But there is a Remedy againſt this too, for tho ſome Men have been deny'd the Converſation of the Living; yet there was never any man depriv'd of the Society of the Dead; of thoſe I mean whoſe Works and Monuments are Reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with all Variety of Learning for the Entertainment of his Thoughts. Here I am inſtructed how to behave myſelf under all the Calamities of Fortune; here my Soul is fill'd with bright Idea<hi>'s,</hi> and with Notions of true Morality; and above all, here I meet with Examples of the braveſt Men, who have endur'd the ſame, or greater Miſeries with Invincible Courage, and by ſo doing have Conſecrated their Memories to after-Ages. Amongſt the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, we ſhall meet with few but were diſgrac'd by Fortune, and ended their Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality in Exile. Inſtead of Repining at fate, they employ'd their Thoughts and Pens in Writing excellent Books of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and by this means made themſelves moſt Publick, when they were under the greateſt Reſtraint; and when they were
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:100787:198"/>
in the neareſt approaches to Death, then did they advance moſt towards Life and Immortality; and ſuch were <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ethius</hi> of old, with infinite others of later date. That Condition therefore cannot be miſerable, which is ſo familiar to the braveſt Souls, and which gives life to ſuch excellent Productions.</p>
               <p>'Tis too uſual for men to compare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with others who are above them, &amp; in reſpect of theſe they many times ſeem unhappy: but let them come and meaſure themſelves by the Majority of Mankind, and ſuch as really are more Afflicted with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Diſcomforts, and then they will find themſelves to be truly happy; For things are good and Evil only by Compa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſon; ſo that what is Evil in reſpect of ſomething that is better, may be ſtyl'd good alſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſomething that is worſe than it ſelf; and he that is happy in one Capacity, may be Miſerable in another, &amp; ſo the contrary. From whence we may take notice of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wiſdom and Providence of Almighty God, who does ſo mix Good &amp; Evil through all Conditions of Men, and carries them on in ſuch a manner through all the Stations and Circumſtances of Life, as ſeems to reduce all Men to a certain State of Equity, ſuch as makes up an univerſal &amp; perfect Harmony. The Great Man enjoys Titles and Honour,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:100787:198"/>
the Poor Man Health: The Great Man lives in reſt and Repoſe of Body, the Poor Man has the better reſt and Repoſe of Mind; he is never vext with Affronts, nor Cracks his Brains to contrive Revenge. He fears not to be degraded from his Place, nor is he Solicitous to make an Intereſt at Court, neither does he live in Jealouſy of thoſe who are about him. He Riſes early to his Work, and merrily paſſes away the Day, and at Night meets with a full reward of his Labour, in the ſweet Refreſhments of Sleep. If Humility depreſs the one, ſo is Nobility a Burden to the other; large Retinues and Numerous Dependences are but Clogs, and are a real weight to him on whom they lie; if one feels Hunger, the other feels Surfeit; if one may be deſpis'd, the other may be Affronted: ſo that upon a Serious and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Survey, the Misfortunes which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the great, are really more unſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than thoſe to which meaner Perſons are uſually expos'd; and what is yet a further Aggravation, they are alſo more publick and laſting. Now whether the Chain be of Gold or of Iron, or whether it be faſtned upon the right Arm or upon the left, makes little difference, ſince in both Caſes there is the ſame reſtraint and Weight.</p>
               <p>Contumely is generally lookt upon as an injury, and ſuch as is apt to Create diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:100787:199"/>
and diſorder in our Paſſions; and yet we may obſerve that the greateſt part of thoſe who pretend to receive injury this way, are really diſquieted at their own Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Fantaſtick <hi>Chimera</hi>'s. This Man being invited to a Feaſt, thinks he is diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd becauſe he is plac'd beneath one which he eſteems of meaner quality than himſelf. That Lady is Mortally injur'd becauſe her Viſit is not return'd. The Squire is ready to quarrel becauſe he has not his title given him in the Superſcription of a Letter, or becauſe his talk is little regarded. Theſe with Infinite ſuch little Humours we find in all the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters of life, ſuch indeed as are the effects only of Idleneſs, &amp; are incident to thoſe who being of a delicate and Effemminate nature, growing wanton from the want of a real injury, form to themſelves Imaginary Evils, that they may have wherewithal to feed their peeviſh temper. But the greateſt part of Mankind make themſelves Miſerable, not ſo much upon the ſenſe of whatthey have loſt, as of what they do not enjoy: And here their Infelicity is as great &amp; Boundleſs as their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite; they deſire things which are impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be obtain'd, and ſo 'tis impoſſible but they muſt be Miſerable. Others ſuffer their Paſſions to faſten on future Enjoyments, which perhaps are Innocent in themſelves: but peradventure alſo ſuch as may never be
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:100787:199"/>
obtain'd; or if obtain'd probably ſuch as may make them more miſerable than Happy. This man deſires Honour and Preferment, which ſhould he Arrive to, 'tis as probable he may prove a Traytor as a Protector of his Country. Another man thinks he may be happy in a Wife and Children, and yet 'tis probable his Wife may prove a Curſe, and his Children if Legitimate, beſides the conſtant thoughts and care for their Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and maintenance, may prove a Scandal rather than an Ornament to his Houſe.</p>
               <p>The Advice therefore of the Heathen Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyriſt, may paſs for ſound Divinity, when he Counſels us not to be too Solicitous after the Endearments of this Life, but to leave the Iſſue of things to the Providence and Wiſdom of the Gods; becauſe <hi>Carior est ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis homo quam ſibi.</hi> Children we ſee are pleas'd with Apples and Nuts, and if they have not their fill of them even to Surfeit, they grow Stubborn and Cry, when they are a little further advanc'd in years, they leave ſuch Childiſh Toys, and follow Plays and Sports; and yet even theſe too are forſaken and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpis'd by them, as they Arrive to further Judgment and Maturity. Now if a man as he Grows older and older, does condemn his paſt Extravagance, and finds thoſethings wherein he once plac'd his chiefeſt Pleaſure to be Fooliſh and Contemptible, why may
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:100787:200"/>
he not be taught the ſame Sentence upon his preſent Delights, when he ſhall recollect his thoughts and conſider; that as God is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely better and more Wiſe than Man, ſo 'tis evident that he does Govern all Things in a courſe of Providence Tranſcendently more perfect than all the Contrivances of the moſt Exquiſite and Conſummate reaſon? ſo that what ſeems good &amp; deſirable by us may bejudg'd by him to be really detrimental, and what ſeems Evil and Hurtful to us may be known to be really good and Beneficial in the Wiſdom of that unerring and Univerſal Governour of all humane Actions. Nay if Man in his Calmer Thoughts does many times Condemn as hurtful, what at another time he did purſue with all Imaginable Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he muſt needs grant that his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Appetite is no firm Standard of his real Felicity; and altho the Child may be Sullen and angry with his Parent for denying him his Fancy, yet in the end he will find how much he is oblig'd to his Paternal Goodneſs in withholding it, as alſo for Curbing his looſe deſires with a due Correction.</p>
               <p>Men, to ſweeten the Cares of their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Courſe of Life, and ſo to render the places of their conſtant Habitation more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, have recourſe uſually to ſome Paſtimes, or labour to refreſh themſelves, by ſeeing fine places, or by viſiting Houſes of Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:100787:200"/>
and good cheer and whereas on the contrary they would Recreate themſelves more ſincerely, would they have recourſe to Severities, and take up ſometimes with pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of worſe Accommodation than that of their own Habitation: for by this means home and a Mans ordinary way of Life, would appear much more delightful after his return to it, and 'tis at home where every Man muſt ſpend his Days: ſo that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the former Method, he who inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits his Domeſtick concerns for ſomething abroad, which ſeems more pleaſant, inſtead of recreating his Mind will find himſelf more diſſatisfyed at his return than before: for Men are never more out of Conceit with their own Condition, than when they come from others, who live in greater Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Splendour than themſelves.</p>
               <p>Proſperity and Adverſity are like the two Arms of the Balance on which the Life of Man do's turn; Reaſon is the Hand which ought to hold it; let us therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the great and ſuddain Viciſſitudes to which all things are ſubject, and that as Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity is not without Fears and Troubles, ſo Adverſity is not without Hopes and Comforts. When Fortune therefore is moſt Careſſing, believe her not. This Coquet Smiles moſt when She intends to Delude: Embrace her therefore with Diſtruſt, and
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:100787:201"/>
thou ſhalt not be troubled when ſhe Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges Countenance, and proves Coy. Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever duly conſiders the uncertainties which attend Proſperity, will neither be lifted up under its Favours, nor be dejected under its Frowns: he ſo conſiders his good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, as one who Hourly expects the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and ſo ſubmits to his Evil Fortune, as one who is in conſtant Hopes of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging for the better. Let him make the beſt uſe therefore of what lies before him, and leave future Contingences to the higher Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers: by this means his Mind will be kept in a conſtant evenneſs: he will ſuffer no Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent Surpriſes either of Joy or Sorrow, but inſtead thereof he will feel one equal, Solid and durable Pleaſure, and ſuch as will leave the Mind in perpetual peace and Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Thus far Reaſon will help him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards towards his own Felicity, but if he be a Chriſtian to whom theſe Conſiderations ſhall Occur, he may receive further Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, by Remembring, that as there is a God who preſides over all the Revolutions of the World, and even in this Life makes what is ſeemingly hurtful to be really Beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial; ſo there is a future State too, where all the Actions of a paſt Life ſhall be expos'd in the open Sight, and where an unfortunate and Proſtrate Innocence ſhall have a full Reward.</p>
